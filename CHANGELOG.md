# Changelog

## 1.1.4 (2026-09-07)

### Added

- **🎨 Krea2 Tiled Diffusion (`FiLKrea2TiledDiffusion`) — 24th node in the pack.**
  Professional edge-aware tiled diffusion engine tailored for Krea2, FLUX.2, and SDXL pipelines.
  Features Sobel-based high-frequency texture injection (`texture_injection`) preventing blur in dense areas, flexible tile grids (2x2 to 4x4 with customizable overlap), color matching transfer (LAB, Wavelet, RGB), and dedicated Identity LoRA integration (`identity_lora_strength`). Complete with a responsive Cyberpunk-themed Vue panel with unrolled direct parameter controls and permanent input sockets (`_filSocketPolicy = always`).
- **🤗 New Cloud Providers: Hugging Face & DeepInfra.**
  Expanded the provider ecosystem to 9 engines. Direct support for **Hugging Face Inference API** (serverless inference router, free tier with no credit card required) and **DeepInfra** (ultra-low latency OpenAI-compatible endpoint), including live model catalog fetching, token probing, and collapsible credentials management in the sidebar `FiL Providers` tab.
- **⚡ Provider Model Picker — Smart Sort & Dynamic Category Chips.**
  Total overhaul of the model selector: smart sorting prioritizing vision and top-tier reasoning models, dynamic filter chips with absolute model counts (**Vision**, **NSFW**, **Fast**, **Free**), one-click reset, and synchronized verified model status badges based on 100% live audited capabilities across all providers.
- **✨ Director Assist & Smart ShowAny Integration.**
  Interactive prompting toolbar in `FiLPrompter` and `FiLPromptDirector` backed by `/fil_design_imagemind/director_assist`. Automatic intelligent graph wiring to `FiLShowAny` for instant inspection without manually pulling multiple data cables.
- **🛡️ Registry Cleanliness & Audit Hardening.**
  Excluded development drafts (`thoughts/`, `docs/design/`) from Comfy Registry packages in `.comfyignore`, reducing distribution archive weight and keeping release integrity pristine.

## 1.1.3 (2026-09-03)

### Added

- **👁️ Show Any (`FiLShowAny`) — Live Visual & Data Preview HUD.**
  Universal data inspector & pass-through monitor gains full interactive visual preview for `IMAGE` and `MASK` signals.
  Features dual view tabs (**🖼️ Preview** and **📊 Info**), 1-click **Copy Image to Clipboard** (direct bitmap export via Clipboard API), **Open in New Tab** inspection, canvas image duplication suppression in LiteGraph, and real-time WebSocket updates (`fil_show_any_update`). Dynamic socket coloring automatically detects and inherits upstream wire types.
- **🛡️ Windows Path & LoRA Normalization.**
  Normalized slash delimiters (`\` vs `/`) and casing in `LoraLoaderPanel.vue` and `useModelQueue.ts`, eliminating false-positive "Missing" warning badges on Windows environments.
- **🌐 Reactive Language Switch & Settings Migration.**
  Instant UI localization updates (English / Русский) without page reload via reactive `useI18n` / `setLocale`. Automatic silent migration of legacy settings keys (`Appearance.Scope`, `Language`).

- **📡 Wireless Dashboard — Interactive HUD and visual management for wireless channels.**
  Floating modal HUD for the wireless distribution engine, invoked via `Alt+W`, menu `FiL Design -> 📡 Wireless Dashboard`, or the bottom panel dock tab.
  Features instant **Focus & Trace** (centers canvas and selects the channel transmitter and all its receiving nodes, even within subgraphs), **Mute / Unmute** (temporarily stops channel signal distribution without pulling physical wires), **Unlink All** (batch detach receivers), data type filter pills (`MODEL`, `VAE`, `CLIP`, `LATENT`, `IMAGE`...), live search, and graph-wide issue diagnostics.
- **📝 Prompter (`FiLPrompter`) — smart text node with live LLM assist buttons.**
  New node in `🧠 FiL Design/LLM`: prompt passes through untouched at queue execution time
  (zero LLM cost), while three assist buttons (rephrase / densify / expand) placed right next
  to the text field edit the prompt live via the `/director_assist` backend route. Connecting a
  Provider Loader powers the assist buttons; unwired runs stay plain text pass-throughs.
- **💬 Prompt Director (`FiLPromptDirector`) — tells the LLM how to rewrite a prompt you already have.**
  New node in `🧠 FiL Design/LLM`: one free-form **instruction** field («сделай
  фотореалистично, как настоящее фото») plus one **source prompt** field (widget text
  or a wired STRING link — the link wins), and out comes a finished DiT prompt that
  follows the instruction while keeping the subject, composition and every detail the
  instruction did not touch. The system prompt carries the pack's DiT rules — high
  density, tactile physical truth, Z-index depth, zero meta-noise — and closes with
  the language rule, placed last because that is the rule models drop first; the
  finished prompt can come out in English, Russian or Chinese (`language` widget).
  Generation parameters stay where they belong — Provider Loader owns temperature,
  max_tokens, rate limit and the unload switch. The `seed` widget doubles as a cost
  control: a fixed seed answers from the ModelClient cache (instant, no API call),
  a fresh seed asks the model for another variant. Answers run through `clean_output`
  so preambles and fences never reach the pipeline — with a new
  `OutputCleanConfig(strip_non_latin=False)` opt-out, because the cleaner's final
  ASCII+Cyrillic pass would otherwise delete every Chinese ideograph. The single
  output is the rewritten `prompt` — a pre-cleanup `raw` twin existed during
  development but never shipped: the cleaned text reads well enough to judge,
  so the diagnostic did not earn its socket. The node ships with
  the pack's branded panel: the two textareas lead it and both accept a STRING
  link (a link overrides the field), then the language segmented control, and
  the seed with its after-generate select rendered at the bottom, Noise Control
  style. The field sockets behave like stock ComfyUI widgets: invisible at
  rest, revealed while a wire is hovered onto the node, and kept up once one
  feeds the field. After FiL saw it on Prompt Director he asked for the same
  everywhere, so `linked` is now the pack-wide default in
  `widgetInputSockets.ts` (`_filSocketPolicy: "always"` opts a node back into
  permanent dots) — Scanner, KSampler, Upscalers and the rest all idle clean.
  The panel is growable (`growable: true` on the DOM widget, OpticScanner's
  idiom): dragging the node box taller hands the spare pixels to the two
  textareas via `flex: 1` instead of leaving dead space under the content,
  and the saved stretch comes back with the workflow.

- **💬 Prompt Director assist buttons — rephrase / densify / expand beside the instruction field.**
  Three 24px icon buttons (Bootstrap Icons, same source as the rest of
  `composables/icons.ts`: `repeat`, `arrows-angle-contract`,
  `arrows-angle-expand`) rewrite the instruction in place through the wired
  Provider Loader's LLM: *rephrase* keeps the exact meaning with clearer
  wording, *densify* cuts filler for a shorter, denser line, *expand* adds
  concrete physical direction — light behavior, material truth, optics,
  Z-index depth — per the pack's DiT rules, zero meta-noise. Every op answers
  in the input's own language and touches only the instruction; the director
  still does the full prompt rewrite afterwards. Backend is a new
  `/director_assist` route over `common/director_assist.py`, which runs
  `ModelClient` one-shot and uncached in a worker thread, the same pattern
  `provider_probe` uses, with the request validated (operation whitelist,
  4000-char cap, known provider, real model). The panel reads
  provider/model/temperature/rate limit off the config link's origin node and
  keeps the buttons disabled until a Provider Loader is wired — the instance
  `onConnectionsChange` hook is patched so the state flips on connect and
  disconnect. The busy button spins; failures surface through the pack's
  toast stack instead of silently eating the text.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder (`FiLEditEncoder`) — one node where the edit pipeline used to want six.**
  Core ComfyUI assembles an FLUX.2-family edit workflow (Krea2, Klein, Dev) out of
  separate pieces: `ImageScaleToTotalPixels` → `VAEEncode` → a chain of
  `ReferenceLatent` nodes — one per reference image — plus a standalone
  `CLIPTextEncode`. The new node in `🎨 FiL Design/🔗 Conditioning` folds the whole
  chain into one: prompt in, auto-growing reference slots (up to ten) in, and out comes
  a single `CONDITIONING` carrying every reference as a VAE-encoded latent plus the
  `reference_latents_method` the model reads. Each reference is resized to a megapixel
  budget the node exposes as a widget (aspect kept, /8-aligned) — with `auto_size` on
  by default, so references smaller than the budget keep their native resolution and
  the budget only caps the big ones (the widget is now split in two — one budget for
  the copy the text encoder reads, one for the copy the VAE encodes). The order on the wire
  is the order on the conditioning even though Autogrow hands the slots back as a dict,
  and references without a wired VAE fail fast with a message instead of silently
  degrading to a text-only encode. The node stays model-agnostic on purpose — it only
  speaks the generic `reference_latents` protocol — and ships with the pack's branded
  panel: prompt textarea, reference cards, mode segments and a live wired-reference
  counter, while the Autogrow slots stay core-managed below it.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder: every reference gets its own job, and its own pull.**
  One prompt preset used to speak for the whole node and one strength dial weighed
  every reference at once, so the thing these graphs exist for — *this* picture for
  its subject, *that* one for its colours, and hold the first harder — could not be
  said. Each slot now takes a **card**: a role, and a signed strength. The role brings
  the image treatment that makes it true instead of promising it in words the encoder
  can ignore; `prompt_preset` is gone, and a saved workflow's old value lands in the
  same widget position and becomes the role that replaced it. Strength weighs one
  reference inside the pass the encoder was going to run anyway, by scaling the
  embeddings that picture produces (`deepstack` included); below zero it encodes once
  more with that reference held out and subtracts past its contribution, which steers
  *away from* the image rather than merely ignoring it. Encoders without that seam
  (FLUX.2's Mistral3) are reported in the `summary` output, never silently ignored.
  Four roles ship — `as is`, `material`, `lighting`, `palette` — because that is how
  many the renders could tell apart: every role that shared a treatment with another
  produced the same picture, and two that used greyscale drained the colour out of the
  result. Cut names still resolve, so saved graphs keep their meaning.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder: one control per decision.**
  Reference cards had left three older widgets saying the same things worse —
  a treatment for every reference at once, the same again as a comma-separated
  list, and a canned encoder role — so the node offered two ways to make one
  choice. All three are hidden now (kept in the schema, because removing a widget
  shifts every saved workflow's values past it by one) and a card's role decides.
  `reference_strength` stopped being a mechanism of its own as well: it used to
  encode the references a second time as blanks and interpolate, and it now
  multiplies the cards through the same seam they use — one pass instead of two,
  one idea instead of two, and it keeps its input socket for driving every card
  from the graph. The panel is down to the prompt, the reference mode, the cards
  and the report. Each card also carries its own warning when its role or its
  strength did not land, because a single sentence at the bottom of the node
  cannot say *which* of five cards it is about.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder: the written instruction has a dial of its own.**
  The pictures could be weighed against each other and against nothing; the words
  could not be weighed at all. Worse, the usual way of trying — `(word:1.2)` — is
  inert on this family: ComfyUI tokenizes Qwen3-VL with `disable_weights=True`
  (`comfy/text_encoders/qwen3vl.py`), so per-word emphasis reaches no edit model
  built on it. `prompt_strength` fills the gap: `0` is what the model took from
  the references alone, `1` the instruction as written, `2` the instruction
  pushed. Rendered on Krea 2 it cross-fades evenly the whole way, which is worth
  saying next to a card's own strength — that one holds its reference until zero
  and then drops it. The instruction is silenced *in place* for the comparison
  pass, its tokens kept and their embeddings zeroed, because removing them would
  change the sequence length and the blend would hand back the unweighted encode
  without a word. Its span is found by tokenizing the same call twice and taking
  the first divergence, so no special-token id is hardcoded anywhere.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder: the per-layer weighting that other packs advertise does not
  apply here, and the seam that does exist is too weak to use.**
  `krea-reference` weighs references "per layer" by splitting the conditioning's
  feature dimension into twelve and scaling the slices. On Qwen3-VL — Krea 2's
  text encoder — that dimension is one layer's hidden state, so those slices are
  arbitrary pieces of a 1024-wide vector, and neither the explanation nor the
  tuned numbers transfer. The architecture does have a genuine depth seam: the
  base image embedding enters at the input while `deepstack` is injected inside
  the transformer at three fixed layers. Weighing those apart was built, rendered
  on Krea 2, and removed — the reference's identity rides the base embedding
  entirely, and the injections carry too little to steer with. No control shipped;
  the renders are recorded in `nodes/_edit_clip_hooks.py` so the idea is not had
  a second time.

- **🎯 Edit Encoder: a reference can be told *when* to speak.**
  A card takes a `window`: `whole run`, `layout`, or `look`. The boundaries come
  from renders rather than round numbers — on Krea 2 at a realistic step count,
  a reference present only in the first 15% hands over its framing and none of
  its identity, while one held back until 40% lends its armour to a figure the
  instruction composed. That is the structure-against-surface separation the
  per-layer experiment failed to find; it lives in sampling time, not in the
  encoder's depth. The same test at 8 steps says the feature does nothing, which
  is a resolution artefact and is written down next to the table so the
  measurement is not repeated badly. Under the hood the run is cut at every
  window edge and each piece encoded with the references that are silent there
  held out, then concatenated — the same `start_percent`/`end_percent` core's
  `ConditioningSetTimestepRange` writes, which is also how the experiment was
  built before any of this existed.

### Changed

- **💬 A linked FilTextArea now recolours instead of dashing.**
  The linked state used to be a dashed accent border over the usual surface —
  at a glance it read as a focus state, and the dash itself was vetoed. The
  field now keeps a solid accent border and tints its fill with the theme
  accent (`color-mix` 14% over the panel fill), so a textarea fed from the
  graph is unmistakable in every FilTextArea caller — Prompt Director, Optic
  Scanner, Decomposer and the rest.

### Fixed

- **📡 A channel's name tag no longer hides under the node it feeds.**
  The tag was painted in the canvas background pass, and LiteGraph draws
  the nodes after that — so wherever a tag and its node overlapped, the
  node won and the name vanished. Tags now draw in the foreground pass,
  above the nodes, and a touch bolder for it, while the dashed links stay
  in the background where they belong. The fake host gained the foreground
  hook, and the overlay tests render both passes now, asserting each one
  still chains the handler it replaced; a smoke case asserts the split
  against the host's real draw loop, on the context each pass brings.

- **📡 The smoke suite runs green against the pack it guards again.**
  Three tripwires had drifted while the Model Cycler and the LoRA Loader
  were landing: the node count the suite holds the backend to still said
  seventeen once the two new nodes made nineteen, and the spelled-out list
  of panel-bearing nodes was missing both panels. The same run gained two
  live cases for what this release changed: the name-tag pass split above,
  and the target dialog's search and filters narrowing a real list. The
  tag case holds one lesson worth keeping — the host's back canvas draws
  with its own context, so the suite instruments the context each pass
  hands in, not the one the canvas advertises.

- **📡 A number channel no longer lands in every number it can reach.**
  A single INT channel called `seed` was wiring itself into
  `BetaSamplingScheduler.steps`, `ImageResize+.multiple_of` and any other
  node that happened to offer exactly one free INT — a seed value where a
  step count belongs, which is a graph that cannot run. ComfyUI now gives
  every widget its own socket, so `steps`, `tile_size`, `overlap` and `seed`
  all look like ordinary free INT inputs to a rule that distributes by type,
  and type says nothing about what a number means. New rule: a widget-backed
  input takes a channel only when the two carry the same name (`seed` feeds
  `seed`, and nothing else) — the contract widget feeds already published.
  Real sockets are untouched, and ticking a target by hand still overrides
  it, because that is the user saying so rather than the pack guessing.
  Found by running the resolver over a real 42-node workflow: 23 links, most
  of them wrong, and 30 inputs listed as unresolved for a conflict that never
  existed. The same workflow now resolves 25 links, every one of them into an
  input that asked for it, and nothing unresolved.

- **📡 A channel is finally the colour of the socket it lands in.**
  Dashed channel links, the coloured dot on each Channel panel row and the
  dots in the Wireless tab were all painted with a hue derived from the
  channel's name, never matching the MODEL or VAE socket they arrive at. The
  lookup asked `LiteGraph.link_type_colors` — a registry ComfyUI does not
  have; the colours live on `LGraphCanvas.link_type_colors`, in the canvas's
  `default_connection_color_byType`, and (for Nodes 2.0) in a
  `--color-datatype-<TYPE>` CSS variable. All three are read now, in that
  order, and a type the host paints with nothing still gets the stable
  name-hash colour as before. A second layer of the same bug went with it: the
  host pre-fills every known type with an empty string before overlaying the
  palette, and an empty string was being accepted as a colour — which paints
  nothing at all. `soften()` also handles `rgb()`/`rgba()` now, so a custom
  colour palette no longer produces an opaque label backing.
  The tests were green throughout because they invented the registry they
  read; the palette now lives in `tests/fakes/comfyHost.ts` in the host's real
  shape, blank entries and CSS variables included.

- **📡 "Draw wireless links" behaves like the setting panel says.**
  With the setting never touched, the code fell back to `Always` while the
  panel showed `Only for the selected Nodes` — so a fresh install drew every
  channel link at once, the exact clutter the selected-nodes mode exists to
  prevent. Both now say the same thing.

- **📡 The smoke suite checks the data actually arrives.**
  Every existing end-to-end case drove the panel and its questions; none
  looked at the prompt. A new one builds the canonical txt2img graph with one
  Channel carrying MODEL, CLIP and VAE, intercepts the queue request and
  asserts each free input reads from the checkpoint loader — and that the
  graph is back as drawn once the queue is done.

### Added

- **📡 A channel's target list can now be searched and filtered.**
  A channel with many receivers lists every free input it could land in,
  and finding one node in that list meant scrolling. The "Channel goes to"
  dialog now carries a search box — matching the node's title, the input's
  label or its raw name — with three chips under it: All, Active (ticked or
  already wired) and Available (enabled and not yet taken). Both reset each
  time the dialog opens, so a filter one channel left behind never hides the
  targets of the next, and a search that matches nothing says so instead of
  leaving an empty list with no reason.

- **📡 Channels can feed same-named widgets — the quiet road for `seed` (opt-in).**
  A KSampler's seed is a widget, not an input: a constant with no socket, so
  no wire — wireless or not — could reach it until converted. The new
  "Channels feed same-named widgets" setting (off by default) adds the quiet
  road: at queue time, a channel whose name matches a widget exactly
  (SEED → `seed`, case-insensitive, types agreeing) replaces the widget's
  literal value with the channel's link — in the prompt only, the graph
  stays exactly as drawn, and the backend sees the same shape a converted
  widget serialises to. Converted widgets stay owned by the link machinery,
  and the node feeding a channel never receives from it. Locked in by the
  `widgetFeeds` cases and a prompt-bridge test asserting the constant stays
  a constant while the setting is off.

- **📡 Channel rows say where the data comes from.**
  The transmitter only forwards, and its panel row showed the channel's
  name, colour and receiver count — knowing which node actually fed it
  meant tracing the wire across the canvas. Hovering the channel name now
  shows a tooltip with the source node and the type it carries ("From
  Checkpoint Loader Simple · type MODEL"), so a row answers what it is and
  from whom on its own. Locked in by a `channelPanel.test.ts` case.

- **⏏️ Provider Loader can unload the local LLM the moment the prompt is written.**
  New "Unload LLM after prompt" switch on the 🔌 Provider Loader panel, right
  above 🌡️ Temperature, visible only for the providers it applies to —
  Ollama and LM Studio, the two that hold a model in the user's own memory.
  With it on, every node that spends the model (Optic Scanner, Image
  Decomposer, Style Mixer's fusion and per-image passes, Cinema Rig's LLM
  Polish, Dataset Forge captioning) tells the local server to drop the model
  once its last generation has answered, so a 7GB prompt model is not sitting
  in VRAM while the image generation that follows tries to fit in the same
  card. Each server speaks its own dialect: Ollama takes its documented
  `keep_alive: 0` request, LM Studio takes the `POST /api/v1/models/unload`
  of its REST API. Cloud providers are ignored, and a failed unload only
  warns — the prompt is already written by the time the cleanup runs, and a
  courtesy to the next stage must not poison it. Off by default: a workflow
  saved before the switch existed behaves exactly as before. Live-verified
  against a running LM Studio on 2026-08-09 — the instance list reads empty
  after the unload call, and the model is back in memory answering the next
  request; locked in by `test_unload_llm.py` and the helper cases in
  `test_provider_runtime.py`.

- **🎨 New setting "Repaint the whole ComfyUI app" (`FiL_Design_ImageMind.Appearance.WholeUi`).**
  Renamed from its first cut, "Theme covers all of ComfyUI" — sitting right
  under "Theme applies to", which has its own "All nodes" option, the two read
  as if this were just a bigger version of that setting. It is not: the scope
  setting only ever tints title bars.
  The scope setting could always widen where *our* painting reaches, but it
  stops at the node title bar — everything outside our nodes is the host's to
  colour. This switch takes the other road: it builds a full ComfyUI color
  palette out of the active theme (`extensionManager.colorPalette`), registers
  it as `fil_<theme>` and selects it, so menus, sidebars, canvas and every
  other pack's nodes wear the theme too. Turning it off restores the palette
  the user was on before; while it is on, switching theme re-exports the
  palette so the application follows. Nothing is written into the workflow
  file — a ComfyUI palette lives in the user's own settings, and the generated
  palette stays in Settings → Appearance → Color Palette, theirs to keep or
  delete. Degrades to a warning toast on hosts without the palette API. Our
  nodes carry explicit LiteGraph colours a palette switch does not touch, so a
  theme change re-asserts them across the open graph. Locked in by the widened
  `appearanceSettings.test.ts` and `comfyPalette.test.ts`.

### Changed

- **✍️ The Krea 2 prompt profile now follows Krea's own docs, and one rule it taught
  went to every model that has no negative prompt.**
  The profile was written against the fal.ai community guide, which budgets 5-20 to
  80-140 words; Krea's own guidance and prompt-expansion system prompt
  ([krea-ai/krea-2](https://github.com/krea-ai/krea-2), `docs/`) say long detailed
  prompts yield the best results, so the target is now one flowing paragraph of
  120-200 words where the detail level leaves room. Four rules came with it, each
  fixing a failure this pack could already produce: the medium is named in the
  opening words — with the stylisation and the proportions that carry it, or a
  cartoon request comes back photoreal; on-image text is asked for exactly once,
  because a second copy in a reflection or a mirrored sign renders as scrambled
  letters; the paragraph closes on one concrete object near enough to see its
  surface; and nothing absent is ever named. That last one is now shared: the words
  *no*, *not* and *without* are banned inside the generated prompt for every profile
  whose target has no negative-prompt field — Z-Image Turbo, FLUX, Krea 2,
  Ideogram 4, Video and MiniMax H3. "Express constraints positively" left the model
  free to write "the street holds no cars", and an image model cannot subtract:
  naming an absent thing tends to add it. The clause lives in one place
  (`_NO_ABSENCE_CLAUSE` in `common/logic.py`) and attaches by the rule's own
  `negative_strategy`, so a new positive-constraints model picks it up unedited —
  and the Video profile's own on-screen-text line, the last place the guidance
  still asked for a negative ("no other lettering, no subtitles"), was reworded
  positively to match.

- **📡 A channel now says what it carries by borrowing its source's own name.**
  Dragging a wire from ♻️ Seed named the channel `INT` — true and useless.
  The slot the wire comes from already calls itself SEED, so the channel
  takes that name whenever the origin slot's name says more than the bare
  type (a slot named after its type changes nothing). The borrowed name is
  what lets rule 8 pair the channel with `seed` inputs on its own, no
  rename needed; a rename typed on the channel still wins, as before.

- **📡 Every CONDITIONING wire is asked "positive or negative?" — the deduction that answered for the user is gone.**
  Exclusion ("the first wire took positive, so this one must be negative")
  was right often enough to be trusted and wrong rarely enough to hurt —
  and a wrong silent name is worse than one more question. The user plugs
  the wire and only the user knows; now every unnamed CONDITIONING wire is
  asked once, and the answer still serialises with the workflow, so it is
  never asked twice for the same wire.

### Fixed

- **📡 Wireless links wore colours no socket on the canvas uses.**
  The dashed channel line, the panel's dot and the diagnostics dot all
  took their colour from a hash of the channel name, while inputs and
  outputs are painted from the host's own type palette — so a link
  feeding a MODEL input landed in a hue that matched nothing next to it.
  They now read `LiteGraph.link_type_colors`, the same registry real
  wires are drawn from, so a wireless link arrives in the socket's own
  colour; the name-hash colour remains only as the fallback for types
  the host paints with nothing of their own. The cost, paid knowingly:
  two channels of one type now share a colour — the label beside the
  input still says which is which. Locked in by `channelColor.test.ts`
  and a `channelPanel.test.ts` case.

- **Page load crashed with `reading '_s'` when the whole-UI palette setting echoed at registration.**
  ComfyUI fires each setting's `onChange` once while registering settings,
  before any Vue app has activated pinia. The "Repaint the whole ComfyUI app"
  handler ran its palette work on that echo — pointless, the host already
  holds the palette ("nothing is needed at startup" was the design) — and
  when the work failed, the catch pushed a toast into a pinia store that did
  not exist yet, turning a degraded palette into a page-load TypeError. The
  handler now ignores the pre-pinia echo, and `toastStore`'s console fallback
  covers any other caller that fires before the store exists; locked in by a
  `toastStack.test.ts` case that toasts with no active pinia.

- **⚡ KSampler crashed on every `ddim`, `uni_pc` and `uni_pc_bh2` run — three samplers its own menu offers.**
  The node always samples through its own `_sample_core` (the eta widget is
  always present, defaulting to 1.0), and that path built the sampler with the
  raw `comfy.samplers.ksampler()` lookup into `comfy.k_diffusion.sampling`.
  That table has no entries for these three — the stock KSampler dispatches
  them through `comfy.samplers.sampler_object()` instead, which maps `ddim`
  to euler-with-random-inpaint and `uni_pc`/`uni_pc_bh2` to `comfy.uni_pc` —
  so every queue with one of them selected died with
  `AttributeError: module 'comfy.k_diffusion.sampling' has no attribute
  'sample_ddim'` before the first step ran. The HighRes-fix resample shared
  the same path and the same crash. Dispatch now goes through the stock
  `sampler_object()` whenever no extra options apply, which is exactly the
  branch the three names can reach (none of them reads eta or BONGMATH);
  optioned samplers keep the `extra_options` table. Found in a live run
  (comfyui.log, 2026-08-10); locked in by
  `test_sample_unified.py::test_special_samplers_dispatch_like_the_stock_ksampler`.

- **Hovering a node's top input painted ghost sockets over it and the title bar.**
  ComfyUI gives every native widget a mirror entry in `node.inputs`, and the
  host's `drawSlots()` reveals any widget socket the pointer is over unless it
  is `alwaysVisible` or linked. On a FiL node every widget is hidden, so the
  mirrors the panel does not turn into sockets never received a row and
  collapsed onto the node's top edge — the same dead pixel as the first real
  input, which is why hovering that input "doubled" it and sprinkled dots into
  the title bar on every node. `exposeWidgetInputSockets` now parks every
  dot-less widget socket (unmanaged mirrors, plus managed ones whose field is
  currently hidden by a collapsed section) below the node's bottom edge, and
  `anchorWidgetInputSockets` keeps them parked as the panel grows; a wire
  loaded from an old workflow still finds its dot, just out of the hover
  path. Locked in by a smoke case against a real LiteGraph.

- **Dataset Forge: the four main sections looked collapsible but ignored the click.**
  The "Who / what is this", "File format", "Captions" and "Write to disk"
  headers rendered with `collapsible="false"` — `FilSection` still draws the
  ▼ arrow for such a header, so it looked interactive while the click died in
  `toggle()`; only "Caption tuning" and "Technical details" actually folded.
  The four sections are now wired to the same `state.ui.collapsed_*` pattern
  the rest of the panel uses (expanded by default, state survives a reload)
  and really hide their fields when folded, nested "Caption tuning" included.
  The same dead-arrow wart was previously fixed in Upscale Tile Calc; locked
  in by the section-collapse cases in `datasetForge.test.ts`.

- **Color Wizard: the "Method" and "Adjustments" headers flipped their arrow but folded nothing.**
  Both rendered as a bare `<FilSection />` with no `model-value` binding, so
  the component toggled its own internal state while the panel never hid a
  control — the ▼/▶ arrow lied on every click. They are wired to the same
  `state.ui.collapsed_*` pattern as every other panel now and really hide the
  method dropdown, the three sliders and the skin toggle when folded; covered
  by a collapse case in `colorWizard.test.ts`.

- **LM Studio could never generate: every chat request went to a path its server does not serve.**
  The Provider Loader's model list builds its URL from the provider
  definition (`base_url` + `models_endpoint`), which is why LM Studio's
  dropdown always filled; but `OpenAIStrategy.get_chat_url` ignored the
  definition's `chat_endpoint` and hardcoded a bare `/chat/completions` onto
  the base URL. Every cloud provider carries `/v1` inside its base URL, so
  the shortcut worked there — LM Studio's base URL is the server root, and
  its chat path is `/v1/chat/completions`. The wrong path gets a 404, which
  the error mapper then reported as "provider offline". The strategy now
  reads `chat_endpoint` from the provider definition (falling back to the
  old shape), which leaves every cloud provider's URL byte-identical and
  makes LM Studio's first-ever local generation work. Found while verifying
  LM Studio end to end through `/provider_probe` on 2026-08-09; locked in by
  `test_models.py`, including a `ModelClient.generate` run asserted against
  the URL it posts to.

- **LM Studio and Ollama offered embedding, whisper and TTS models as chat models.**
  Local servers list everything they can serve and publish no capability
  metadata, so the dropdown filter — which already rejected OpenAI's
  `text-embedding-3-large` and Groq's whisper — had nothing to say about
  them: a live LM Studio listing put `text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5`
  in the Provider Loader dropdown next to the one model that could actually
  answer. `NON_CHAT_MARKERS` now carries entries for both local providers
  (`embed`, `whisper`, `tts`); covered by the parametrized cases in
  `test_model_capabilities.py`.

- **Nodes 2.0: title text, the "Show advanced inputs" bar and widget-less nodes wore the stock light chrome.**
  The Vue renderer reads `node.color` — which the pack pins to `#ffffff` for
  the canvas title text — as a *light surface*: it derived the header's text
  colour for a white bar (dark-on-dark under our themed one) and handed the
  footer button its background outright, a stark white strip under every
  panel. `styles/vueNodeSkin.ts` now forces the title to the same crisp white
  the canvas uses and repaints the footer bar with the node's own title-bar
  fill, rounded to the theme's radius. And `FiLTileAssembly`, which has no
  widgets and therefore never mounted a panel, never carried the
  `.fil-node-shell` marker the skin keys off — it now mounts a one-line
  description panel, which is both the marker and the only UI the node had no
  home for; the smoke suite's panel list grew accordingly. On the canvas
  renderer the title had vanished outright: current LiteGraph treats
  `onDrawTitleText` as a full replacement for its default title paint, and
  the hook only set a fill style — it now draws the title itself, mirroring
  the host's font, truncation and pinned-suffix behaviour. Tile Assembly's
  200px height floor, set back when the node had no panel, shrank to match
  its new content.

- **Panels dropped their frame rate while the graph was dragged or zoomed.**
  Every FiL node body carries `backdrop-filter: blur(...)` — 10–16px depending
  on theme — and that is the one effect whose cost is paid again on every
  frame: the browser re-samples and re-blurs whatever sits behind the panel,
  and both the panel and the canvas behind it move continuously during a drag.
  The cost scales with how many panels are on screen, which is why the stutter
  came and went. The blur is now dropped while the canvas is actually moving
  and restored 200ms after it settles, so a drag made of separate flicks does
  not flash the glass on and off. At rest nothing changes. Deliberately not a
  host patch: passive listeners on the canvas element itself, no `window`
  listener (ours on `wheel` once silenced the scroll wheel for every other
  pack) and no wrapped core method. Covered by `canvasMotion.test.ts`, driven
  through the fake host's real canvas element rather than by calling the
  handlers directly.
- **ComfyUI's Nodes 2.0 renderer (`Comfy.VueNodes.Enabled`) — the pack claimed
  support it did not have.** With the setting on, verified live against
  comfyui_frontend_package 1.48.7, not one FiL panel appeared: the user got the
  raw list of native widgets instead of the node's UI. Two wrong guesses about
  the host, one each:
  - The panel carried `canvasOnly: true`, set to keep it out of the right-side
    properties panel. Core documents that flag as "the widget will not be
    rendered by the Vue renderer" (`litegraph/src/types/widgets.ts`) and
    `shouldRenderAsVue` drops such a widget before anything else looks at it.
    The panel now uses `hideInPanel`, the narrow flag for exactly this case —
    out of the side panel, still drawn on the node body.
  - The native widgets a panel replaces were hidden with `widget.hidden`, which
    only the canvas renderer reads. The Vue renderer decides from
    `widget.options.hidden` alone (`isWidgetVisible`, and see
    `extractWidgetDisplayOptions` for the fields it copies), so every hidden
    field came back as a live row above the panel — 🎬 Cinema Rig at nine
    duplicated rows and twice the height. All 16 node modules now hide through
    one `hideWidget`/`hideNativeWidget` helper that writes both.
  Locked in by `vueNodes.test.ts` against a fake host that reimplements the two
  visibility rules, so "renders under Nodes 2.0" is now a thing the suite can
  actually fail on.
- **Under the Vue renderer, no wire could reach a field inside a panel.** A
  widget-backed input gets exactly one connection dot there and it lives inside
  that widget's own row, which is drawn only for visible widgets — and a FiL
  node hides every field its panel replaces. Dropping the wire on the node body
  does not help either: that path resolves an input by type and then wants a
  registered slot layout, which a row that was never drawn does not have. So
  the prompt of 🕵️ Optic Scanner, and every other field with a socket, was
  simply unreachable. The rows for those fields now stay, stripped in CSS to a
  labelled dot — the shape ComfyUI's own "convert widget to input" always had —
  while the field's control stays where it belongs, in the panel. Which fields
  get one is not a new decision: it is the same `*_SOCKET_INPUTS` list each node
  already declares for the canvas renderer. Verified live by dragging a STRING
  output into 🕵️ Optic Scanner's `prompt`.
- **Themes looked like stock ComfyUI under the Vue renderer.** A node's title
  bar, its frame and the inline badge pill are painted with a brush on the
  LiteGraph canvas — which does not exist under Nodes 2.0, where a node is a DOM
  element. `styles/vueNodeSkin.ts` is the same chrome as CSS, values copied from
  the canvas code: per-theme stripe, glow and corner radius, the Pipboy and
  Cyber Punch HUD whole-node frames with their corner brackets, and the pill.
  Nothing detects the renderer: every rule hangs off `.lg-node`, a class that
  only the Vue renderer emits, scoped by `:has(.fil-node-shell)` to nodes
  carrying one of our panels — so foreign nodes stay untouched and no marker is
  written into anyone else's DOM. Also fixes the header band rendering stark
  white there, which is what the Vue renderer makes of the `node.color` the pack
  pins for a canvas-side reason.
- **The left accent stripe on a node title was white, in every theme that has
  one.** `onDrawTitleBar` read `fgcolor || <theme colour>`, and `fgcolor` is
  `node.renderingColor` — i.e. `node.color`, which this pack pins to `#ffffff`
  — so the fallback never ran and the accent never showed. Both renderers now
  name the theme colour outright.
- **Pipboy's "узел в узле" — one frame around the whole node instead of three
  fighting ones.** The theme used to stroke a green rectangle around the TITLE
  alone (`onDrawTitleBar`), drop corner brackets on the DOM panel's own border,
  and leave the slot row floating between boundaries that matched neither —
  the exact box-inside-a-box shape flagged from a live screenshot. The
  title-only stroke and the card's own border/shadow are gone; `onDrawForeground`
  now draws a single phosphor frame (rounded rect + all four corner brackets,
  CRT-bezel trope) around title, slots and body together. The logic is shared
  with `cyber_punch_hud` through a `FRAME_THEMES` table, since both themes hit
  the identical bug and `onDrawForeground` is the only hook that runs after the
  body and badges are painted.
- **NFT Vibe was mixing its two brand hues in the same glow instead of picking
  one per element.** Flagged from a live screenshot of a real 17-node
  workflow: the card had a lime border and a violet ambient glow at once, the
  active-chip highlight blended a lime shadow with a violet one on top of it,
  and `muted` — the token nearly every widget label reads — was itself violet,
  so secondary text fought the lime accent across every node on screen. The
  reference swatch (Blanche White / Banana Yellow / Plum Violet) only ever
  uses violet as one of three solid blocks, never as running text. Fixed by
  giving each hue one job: violet is now the card border, the glass/field
  border and the section-divider fill (`--fil-surface-border`,
  `--fil-glass-border`, `--fil-input-border` all switched from lime to
  violet), lime is reserved for the active/focus state alone (chip highlight
  glow dropped its violet half; the seed-pill hover glow dropped its lime
  half in favour of violet, matching its own violet fill), and `muted` moved
  from `#c084fc` to a neutral `#c7c5cc` (11.7:1 on the panel) so body text
  stops competing with either brand colour.

### Changed

- **Pipboy reworked against the pip-boy.com reference.** The tube blips, it
  does not strobe: a 6-second CRT flicker (one opacity dip near the end)
  replaces both the travelling scanline band (1.2s loop) and the beam sweep
  (6s loop) — motion the reference never had, running on every visible node at
  once. The flat panel fill becomes a radial phosphor vignette (green at the
  centre falling to black at the corners), and the scanlines stay ruled but
  quiet — still 1px lines every 4px in `overlay`-blended white instead of
  moving 2px green/black bars. Muted text moves `#00b800` → `#98ffa1` per the
  reference, which takes secondary text *lighter* on a phosphor screen; the
  old value sat right on the AA floor at 4.8:1, the new one reads at 16.4:1 on
  the node surface. With "Theme animations" off the flicker freezes but the
  scanlines stay ruled — same colours, no movement.
- **Optic Scanner and Dataset Forge now report progress through the V3
  `ComfyAPISync.Execution.set_progress` API — and show the frame being
  processed.** Both nodes used `comfy.utils.ProgressBar`, which only carries
  numbers; the V3 API ships the preview frame alongside the progress event
  with node metadata, so during a multi-frame analyse run or a dataset
  captioning batch the UI shows the exact frame the model is looking at right
  now. The plumbing lives in a new `common/progress.py` (`FilProgress`), which
  picks its backend once at import: the V3 sync API where it exists, the
  legacy bar on hosts older than ComfyAPI v0.0.2 — the pack still installs
  there, so the fallback is a compatibility boundary rather than dead code
  (previews are simply dropped on those hosts). Locked in by
  `tests/test_progress.py` (backend selection, call shape, legacy fallback,
  and the captioning batch wiring that asserts each progress tick carries its
  own frame).
- **The two example workflows moved from `docs/workflows/` to
  `example_workflows/` — and now show up in Workflows → Browse Templates.**
  ComfyUI scans `custom_nodes/*/example_workflows/*.json` and serves whatever
  it finds there through `/workflow_templates`, so the graphs the README
  already shipped as drag-and-drop starters are now also one click away in the
  host's own template gallery (and visible on the registry page, which reads
  the same folder). The graphs themselves are unchanged — same two files,
  re-synced to the current schema at 1.1.2 — only the address moved. The move
  is followed through everywhere the old path was named: README (EN + RU),
  `pyproject.toml` package data, the `.comfyignore` shipping note, the two
  documentation tests that open the graphs, and the frontend comments that
  point at them.
- **📋 The pack's two actions are now in the menu bar under a top-level
  "FiL Design" group.** The keyboard cheatsheet and "save this theme as a
  ComfyUI palette" were reachable only through Shift+? and the command
  palette — which is where discoverability went to die. Both are now
  registered through the declarative `menuCommands` extension property; the
  host's menu store creates the top-level group the first time it meets the
  path, so nothing host-side needs setting up. Each command gained a short
  `menubarLabel` ("Keyboard cheatsheet", "Save theme as palette"), because the
  host renders that field verbatim and does not fall back to the longer
  command-palette label. Locked in by `tests/menuCommands.test.ts`: every
  menu id must also be a declared command (the host silently drops ones that
  are not) and every menu-bound command must carry a `menubarLabel` (the
  entry renders blank without one).
- **Pixaroma's surface tokens remeasured against the sibling pack's real node
  faces.** The values previously came from its full-screen paint editor — one
  shade blacker than the nodes themselves, with solid opaque border-greys.
  Measured against the actual node-face CSS (`.pix-ops-sl`, `.pix-xy-field`,
  `.pix-xy-input`, `.pix-xy-combo` all share `background:#1d1d1d` with
  `1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.14)` borders at radius 5px), the glass fields
  move `#111111` → `#1d1d1d`, every border `#3a3d40` → the translucent
  `rgba(255,255,255,0.14)`, and the field radius 4px → 5px. The one token the
  sibling pack cannot supply — `--fil-surface-border`, its nodes carry no card
  of their own at all — stays invented, but drops the opaque grey for a
  barely-visible `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` wash against a dark canvas.

## 1.1.2 (2026-08-06)

The video release, with a wireless heart. Optic Scanner became the pack's
video department — two new targets (a universal Video profile and MiniMax H3
timelines), four shot-parameter widgets that only exist for video targets,
and a prompting rewrite paid for with live renders. Around it: 📡 Channel
finishes wireless data transfer (conflict picking, a diagnostics tab), 🎬
Cinema Rig joins the styling department, the style libraries completed their
first full live-render sweeps, two Cyber Punch themes join the theme layer,
and a long row of interaction fixes — scrubbing number fields, seed-linked
controls graying out, the language rule finally closing every system prompt.
Saved workflows load unchanged. The output that does change: video-target
prompts (rewritten guidance), Ideogram 4 prompts (the v4 API has no
negative-prompt field), and the style-library presets whose endings and
anchors the sweeps rewrote.

### Added

- **🕵️ Optic Scanner grew four video shot parameters — Output widgets that
  appear the moment `model_type` switches to Video or MiniMax H3 and vanish
  for every image target.** Selecting a video profile now surfaces ⏱
  `video_duration` (slider; 0 = Auto; the range follows the profile — Video
  2-20s, MiniMax H3 4-15s, the API's hard limit, re-clamped at injection so a
  stale value after a model switch can never produce an invalid prompt), 📐
  `video_aspect` (Auto/16:9/9:16/1:1/21:9, written into the shot framing —
  for H3 into the timeline header line), 🔊 `video_sound` (Auto / Off =
  silent clip / Layered = mandatory ambience+foley+music clause) and 🎥
  `video_camera` (ten preset moves, injected as a preference the LLM builds
  the shot around, adapting per story stage). Non-Auto values land in a
  `SHOT PARAMETERS` block placed after the model guidance in both Hybrid and
  Two-Stage system prompts, so user-fixed facts override the guidance's
  defaults; all-Auto runs stay byte-identical to the pre-widget output, and
  hidden values persist in the workflow — switching back to a video profile
  restores them on screen. The chosen parameters are echoed in
  `metadata_dict.video_params` (with a `duration_clamped` flag); the key is
  absent for image runs. Mechanically this is the first real consumer of the
  contract schema's dormant `visible_when` / `visible_when_value` fields —
  OpticScanner.vue now evaluates them generically, and the panel gained a
  FilSlider branch (its first slider) plus a FilSelect for the ten-option
  camera list. Both example workflows were re-synced to the wider schema,
  locales carry EN/RU tooltips, and the feature is locked in by
  `test_video_shot_parameters.py` (18 tests: clamp ranges, block assembly,
  byte-identical all-Auto, both bundle stages, node-level metadata/gating)
  and five new OpticScanner component tests (visibility per model type,
  dynamic slider bounds, clamp-on-switch, hidden-value persistence).

### Fixed

- **The language rule is now genuinely the last block of the system prompt, in
  both Hybrid and Two-Stage.** `execute()` stacked the style overlays
  (enforcement / NSFW overlay / custom style) on top of the bundle *after* the
  bundle had appended the language rule, so a `language=ru` run with any style
  selected ended with English style prose after "write in Russian" — the exact
  burial the 2026-07-29 run over 132 models flagged (29% answered in English
  when the rule sat mid-prompt). `build_system_prompt_bundle()` and
  `build_system_prompt_two_stage_bundle()` now return the rule separately and
  the node appends it after every overlay (stage 2 included), locked in by two
  node-level tests asserting the final sent system prompt ends on the rule.
- **A locked `video_aspect` now outranks wired width/height sockets.** With
  the widget at `16:9` and a 4:3 resolution wired in, the prompt used to carry
  two contradictory framing instructions, and the socket-derived one read
  later. The socket guidance is now skipped for video profiles whenever the
  widget is non-Auto (image targets and Auto keep it, unchanged).

### Changed

- **📖 `docs/ETA_GUIDE.md` rewritten to match the actual code path.** The
  previous version hand-waved the math ("Noise Added = eta × Standard Noise
  Factor"), carried an incomplete sampler table, listed a nonexistent
  "ClownsharKSampler" in the subtitle and framed `eta > 1` as pure artifact
  risk. The guide now documents the real `get_ancestral_step` split
  (`sigma_up` / `sigma_down`, including the `sigma_up ≤ sigma_to` clamp that
  saturates the effect above ~1–2), the full `_ETA_SAMPLERS` allowlist
  (+`cfg_pp`/`_gpu` variants, `dpm_adaptive`) plus runtime signature-detected
  RES4LYF samplers (`rk_beta`, whose native default is 0.5), the documented
  exclusion traps (`er_sde`/`sa_solver`/`dpm_fast`), seed-based
  reproducibility of the injected noise, and a new section on how FiL KSampler
  routes eta — silent skip + frontend grayout for samplers that ignore it, so
  a stale `eta` value can never crash a deterministic sampler with TypeError.
  Both RU and EN versions updated symmetrically; no code changes.

- **🔬 HighRes Fix's 🔁 Iterations moved out of the ADVANCED fold — it now
  sits right under 🪜 Hires steps in the always-visible panel.** It was
  collapsed by default next to set-once controls (Hires checkpoint,
  ControlNet), but the pass count is an everyday quality knob you tweak
  run-to-run, so hiding it one click away was friction for no gain. ADVANCED
  now keeps only the Hires checkpoint and the ControlNet stack. The widget's
  name, 0–5 range, default and the backend `iterations` behaviour are
  untouched — saved workflows, socket wiring and packed scripts are all
  unaffected; `hiResFix.test.ts` updated to assert Iterations is visible with
  ADVANCED collapsed.

- **🕵️ Optic Scanner's Video and MiniMax H3 prompting was rewritten around four
  observed failure modes.** Runs against real video targets kept producing (1)
  still-frame prompts — a caption of the image with nothing actually moving;
  (2) collapsed structure — timestamps leaking into the universal Video
  profile, beats missing their `Sound:` clause in H3 timelines; (3) weak or
  irrelevant sound — one generic ambience word instead of a clause tied to
  what is on screen; (4) vague camera — "camera moves" with no shot size,
  angle or move character. The universal **Video** guidance (`common/logic.py`)
  now opens with the motion-first principle ("a video prompt is a shot
  unfolding in time, not a picture description"), teaches the LLM to read a
  wired image as one frozen instant and project its motion evidence forward,
  demands secondary motion (hair, fabric, dust, parallax), light that changes
  during the shot, a full shot-size/angle vocabulary, exactly ONE named camera
  move per shot (compound moves confuse every video model), a style/treatment
  anchor, a layered sound-design clause (ambience bed + foley from the visible
  action + music mood) and `Image N` reference roles; it still forbids
  timestamps/shot lists/bracket tags because every non-MiniMax parser in the
  class reads free text only. The dedicated **MiniMax H3** guidance was
  re-verified against platform.minimax.io on 2026-08-05 and gained the API
  facts: 4–15 whole-second durations, `9:16 vertical` header variant, inline
  camera tags `[pan]`/`[zoom]`/`[static]`, reference jobs on the first line,
  no-gaps/no-overlap beat coverage of the whole duration, one motion + one
  camera move per beat (empty beats get merged, never padded), same-word
  subject naming for identity across cuts, a style/tone anchor, and a layered
  `Sound:` clause that evolves with the beats. Post-conversion
  (`common/model_prompt_adapters.py`) is now video-aware too: timelines keep
  one beat per line, universal video prose flattens to the promised single
  paragraph, and truncation retreats to a sentence boundary and never cuts
  inside a `[beat]` bracket span or leaves a trailing ellipsis, instead of
  shredding the last beat mid-word. Both video contracts' word ceilings
  (Video 150, H3 250) are now enforced by the converter even when a roomier
  detail level is set — video models follow short concrete shots better than
  dense walls of text. New guidance assertions in `test_prompt_pipeline.py`,
  adapter/truncation tests in `test_all_models_prompting.py`, and a MiniMax
  vendor-compliance section in `test_official_vendor_compliance.py` lock all
  of it in; `docs/prompting.md` updated to match.

### Added

- **🎬 Cinema Rig (`FiLCinemaRig`) — a camera-department shot builder.** Style
  Mixer blends flat style overlays; Cinema Rig assembles a shot from five
  orthogonal rig axes — camera body, lens, focal length, aperture and color
  grade — the way a cinematographer actually specs a frame. 6 bodies, 6 lenses,
  6 focal lengths, 5 apertures and 14 grades combine into a deterministic
  assembly (no API call), wrapped in film or digital medium language depending
  on the camera's type so the output always names a capture. Two modes:
  `Original Shot` rides the user's scene through the rig untouched, and
  `Reshoot` locks a reference image's identity/pose/props and only changes the
  camera treatment. An optional `LLM Polish` rewrites the assembly into fluent
  prose through the provider model, falling back to the deterministic rig on
  any failure. Outputs both the `rigged_prompt` and the `rig_overlay` (camera
  treatment alone, stackable under any prompt). Presets are original to this
  pack and held by the same guards as the photo library.

### Changed

- **A linked `seed` input now grays out its companion controls, matching stock
  ComfyUI, in every panel that has one.** FiLKSampler's 🔁 After generate was
  fixed first; an audit of every socket-exposing node found two more spots
  where a wire into `seed` left its companions live: FiLNoiseControl's 🔁
  After generate stayed editable next to a driven variation seed, and
  FiLHighResFix's Seed source segmented plus the Random / Use last / New fixed
  row stayed clickable while the link overwrites the value at queue time. All
  three now disable and show the shared "Driven by the connected input"
  tooltip; `FilSeedRow` grew a `disabled` prop so HiResFix can gray the whole
  row. Nodes checked and already correct: DatasetForge (seed grays, its
  after-generate is intentionally pinned `fixed`), OpticScanner and FiLSeed
  (no seed socket at all), ColorWizard `saturate` and StyleMixer
  `base_prompt` (graph-only sockets with no panel field).
- **The two art-library `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` presets left unconfirmed after four
  rewrites each are now fixed — on a fifth attempt, using a different lever
  than "say it's hers" one more time.** `Golden Mechanical Portrait` kept
  building a separate golden statue because its own opening words — "golden
  cyberpunk mechanical...portrait art" — set up a golden mechanical *subject*
  before "her" was ever mentioned; moving every "golden"/"regal"/"luxury"
  word out of the opening and into a clause that only modifies her hand
  fixed it outright. `Neuro-Interface` kept rendering nothing because "a cold
  blue monitor glowing on the desk beside her" was a full second scene
  competing for the same detail budget as a small neck feature; dropping the
  monitor and forcing an extreme close-up crop — the same fix as Macro
  Micro-world and Bath Scene earlier this session — finally got the hardware
  on screen. The first render of the fixed Neuro-Interface came back as a
  giant collar dwarfing a tiny figure — this session's usual full-body test
  subject fighting a preset that explicitly asks for a close-up — and cleared
  up completely once tested against a matching portrait-crop subject instead,
  the same test-harness collision already on record for Macro Micro-world.
  `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` in the art library is now 9 for 9.
- **NSFW libraries: photo half live-swept clean, art half partially swept, 3
  text-only fixes unverified.** Testing NSFW presets first needed a checkpoint
  swap — the "official" krea2 checkpoint used for every other sweep this
  session suppresses explicit content regardless of what the prompt asks for,
  confirmed by rendering the identical prompt against both and getting a
  clothed figure from one and a compliant result from the other. Switched to
  `darkBeastKrea2` for this pass. With the right checkpoint, `NSFW_PHOTO_STYLES`
  (66 presets, all 8 categories including `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК`) came back clean — 0
  confirmed anchor bugs, including three presets predicted high-risk from text
  alone that all rendered fine. That reverses this session's working
  assumption: the anchor bug's presence in photo/art `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` was not
  proof NSFW cyberpunk would have it too. One separate pattern noted, not
  fixed: 3 presets that ask for lingerie/swimwear (`Glamour Core`, `Fashion
  Editorial`, `Swimsuit Campaign`) render fully nude anyway — reads as a
  checkpoint-level pull the way `Golden Mechanical Portrait` resisted four
  rewrites, not something preset wording fixes.

  `NSFW_ART_STYLES` (46 presets) is only partially confirmed: `🎨 ИЛЛЮСТРАЦИЯ`
  (8) and `💻 ЦИФРОВАЯ` (3) rendered clean. The remaining 35 across 8
  categories never rendered — the sweep was interrupted mid-run twice and was
  not restarted a third time. Of those, `📜 КЛАССИКА`, `🎯 ЖАНРЫ`, `🖌️ ЖИВОПИСЬ`,
  `✒️ СКЕТЧ`, `🏰 ФЭНТЕЗИ` and `🕰️ РЕТРО` (26 presets) describe medium and
  technique only, the same shape that held up clean across ЖИВОПИСЬ/ГРАФИКА/
  ИСТОРИЯ/КОМИКС/ДИДЖИТАЛ in the main art library — low risk by pattern, but
  pattern is not proof, as this same session just demonstrated in the other
  direction. `🚀 SCI-FI` and `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` (9 presets) is where the anchor bug
  would actually be expected; three of those — `Cyberpunk NSFW`, `Synthetic
  Skin`, `Glowing Fiber Optics` — had the unanchored-property shape and were
  given the same fix already confirmed elsewhere, but with no render behind
  it this time. Marked `# not yet render-verified` in-file rather than
  presented as confirmed repairs.
- **Text review of the art library's remaining 110 presets (everything outside
  `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК`), one confirmed fix.** `🎨 ЖИВОПИСЬ`, `✏️ ГРАФИКА`, `🏛️ ИСТОРИЯ`,
  `💥 КОМИКС` and `👾 ДИДЖИТАЛ` describe medium and technique only — nothing
  claims an attached part the way cyberware does, so the anchor bug that broke
  9 of 19 `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` presets has nowhere to occur. One direct parallel
  found anyway: `💻 ЦИФРОВАЯ/🌫️ Atmospheric Sci-Fi Mist` carried the exact same
  wording as the photo library's own Atmospheric Sci-Fi Mist before *that* one
  was fixed earlier this session — generic fog with nothing sci-fi about it.
  Same anchor applied, confirmed by a live before/after render. Two things
  spotted but left alone pending a live sweep: six presets in `🔬 СТИЛИЗАЦИЯ`
  read as close variations of one dark-gothic-portrait concept (worth checking
  whether they're actually distinct on screen); a couple of presets elsewhere
  in `💻 ЦИФРОВАЯ` name decorative accents with no clear location, but
  low-stakes enough not to act on without a render to confirm.
- **The art library's `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` category (19 presets) got the same live
  sweep the photo library already went through — first review of the 129-entry
  art library since it shipped.** 9 of 19 came back with no augmentation
  visible on the subject at all, worse than the photo cyberpunk category's 8
  of 30. Five had the familiar bug — properties named with no body part to
  land on (`Nanopunk Swarm`, `Bio-Corroded Tech`, `Angelic Cyber Feminine`,
  `X-Ray Skeleton Cyber Anime`, `White Android Minimal Portrait`). Four showed
  a shape this session hadn't seen before: the augmentation rendered in full,
  glowing detail — as scenery around the subject rather than on her
  (`Mecha Pilot`'s cockpit, `Neuro-Interface`'s monitor, `Industrial Female
  Cyborg Portrait`'s machinery backdrop, `Golden Mechanical Portrait`'s gold
  hall). The photo library's own `Industrial Cyborg Portrait` carries nearly
  identical wording and rendered fine as a photograph; the same words as
  "digital portrait art" pulled toward a character-sheet convention instead —
  subject standing in front of her machine, not wearing it. Fixed by saying
  whose the part is, not just naming it: "her own skull", "her own shoulder".
  6 of 9 confirmed fixed on the first or second attempt. Two — `Neuro-Interface`
  and `Golden Mechanical Portrait` — resisted three to four structurally
  different rewrites each and are left in their best-reasoned state,
  documented in-file as unconfirmed rather than iterated on indefinitely; the
  art library's remaining 110 presets have not been swept.
- **64 presets no longer close on the word "realism".** A third of the photo
  library ended in an adjective plus `realism` — "cinematic movement realism",
  "moody urban realism", "tactile engineering realism" — which names no camera,
  no practice and no context, and left distinct styles reading as variations of
  each other. Each ending now says who takes this kind of picture and why:
  "a picture somebody took on their phone", "shot from the photographers' pit",
  "film that sat in a drawer too long". Two tests hold the line. One category
  moved as a result, for the better: `Cybernetic Arm Close-Up` now resolves to
  `cyborg` instead of scraping past `oil_painting` on the photo-library guard.
- **20 of the 36 `🗺️ СЦЕНЫ` presets now have a moment passing in them.** The
  scenes were the stillest group in the library — an empty set with the lights
  on and nobody in it, which is most of why the photo half read as a postcard.
  `Piano Studio` was polished wood and window light; it now has the lid propped
  open, the bench pushed back and a pencil across the open score. What each one
  gained is evidence rather than plot: dust turning in a beam, a shop bell still
  swinging, a gap in the shelf where something was just lifted out. None of them
  gives the subject an action to perform — a scene preset stacks under the
  user's own prompt and must not decide what the person in it is doing.

### Changed

- **The photo library has been fully swept live.** `🏠 ИНТЕРЬЕР`, `🏜️ ЖАНРЫ`,
  `📐 МОДИФИКАТОРЫ`, `🎬 КИНО` and `📸 РЕПОРТАЖ` — the last 27 unchecked
  presets — came back with zero breaks, closing out a category-by-category
  live sweep of all 171 `common/styles/photo.py` entries. Final count: 12
  broken, 12 fixed — 8 in `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК`, 2 in `🧪 ЭФФЕКТЫ`, 2 in `⏱️ ЗАХВАТ`,
  plus the earlier `🗺️ СЦЕНЫ` repair — against 159 that held up on inspection.
  Full tally and the two known false-positive traps (a style colliding with
  the *test subject* rather than the model; a style surfacing an unrelated
  model quirk) are recorded in `docs/styles.md`. The art library and both
  NSFW libraries have not been swept this way.
- **`⏱️ ЗАХВАТ`, `🕰️ РЕТРО`, `📷 КАМЕРЫ`, `🏙️ СРЕДА`, `👗 ФЭШН` swept live — 2 of
  47 needed fixing.** Both in `⏱️ ЗАХВАТ`, and both the same disease from a new
  angle: `Gesture Smear` described the smear and never the movement to smear —
  nothing told the model a hand was doing anything, so a live render came back
  as two ordinary static women. Wind Gust solved the equivalent problem with an
  outside force (wind) that needs no cooperation from the subject's pose; a
  hand has no such shortcut, so this now names the smallest, most generic
  gesture that fits almost any pose — brushing hair back, adjusting a cuff.
  `Rolling Shutter Skew` leaned entirely on "spoke and propeller geometry",
  which most scenes don't contain and had no fallback; a render with neither in
  frame came back with no skew at all. Led instead with the one thing every
  photograph already has — vertical lines in the background — with the
  spoke/propeller case kept as a bonus when one is present. The other 45 held
  up, `📷 КАМЕРЫ` and `🏙️ СРЕДА` in particular each reading as nine distinct,
  unmistakable places rather than variations on each other.
- **`🧪 ЭФФЕКТЫ` and `🗺️ СЦЕНЫ` swept live — 2 of 67 needed fixing.** `HDR
  Dynamic` described the merging process ("three bracketed exposures, tone
  mapping, highlight recovery") and never the visible signature that process
  leaves; a render came back as an ordinary daylight photo. Now names the tell
  — glowing halos on cloud edges, colours pushed loud, shadow texture that
  shouldn't be visible — the recognisable "loud HDR" look. `Цифровой муар`
  named "a fine repeating pattern" with nowhere to put it, and moire is an
  interference effect between two grids — with nothing supplying the second
  grid, the render was a plain portrait against a plain wall. Anchored to a
  perforated metal grille in the background. Two more natural word choices for
  that grille — "screen", "venetian blind" — turned out to be `cinema`
  category triggers that would have rewritten "photograph" into "70mm capture"
  the moment the preset stacked through Smart LLM Fusion; checked the final
  wording against the full keyword list before settling on it. The other 65
  presets — all 36 `🗺️ СЦЕНЫ` (already repaired earlier this session) plus 29
  of `🧪 ЭФФЕКТЫ` — held up on inspection.
- **A written rule for style prose, and one narrow test instead of a broad
  one.** `docs/styles.md` now opens with how to write a preset: the
  comma-separated noun-phrase shape is deliberate (a style stacks *under* the
  user's prompt and must stay neutral), and the real failure is naming a
  property with nothing to attach it to — the single cause behind the ЗАХВАТ,
  СЦЕНЫ and КИБЕРПАНК repairs. Two attempts to enforce that automatically were
  built and thrown away: a "connective phrasing" regex failed `Long Exposure
  Ghost` and `Handheld Grab Shot`, both proven working by live render, and a
  rule requiring augmentation presets to name a body part had a 60%
  false-positive rate — full-body armour needs no address. Only the
  unambiguous half is now a test: no preset may order the frame emptied, the
  contradiction that made `White Android Minimal Studio` delete its own
  subject.
- **Eight `🦾 КИБЕРПАНК` presets rewritten after a live sweep of all 30 came back
  showing no cyberware at all.** `Wirehead Junkie`, `Corpo-Cyborg`, `Military
  Cyborg`, `Post-Apoc Cyber` and `Solarpunk Hybrid` listed materials —
  "exposed wires, damaged cyberware, rusted metal parts" — without ever naming
  a body part to put them on, and every one rendered as an ordinary person on
  an ordinary street. The presets that already worked, `Bio-Mechanical Core`
  and `Cybernetic Arm Close-Up`, always named where: chest, arm. Each of the
  five now does too — a prosthetic forearm, a neural jack at the neck, an
  armoured arm — and a re-render shows a real, unmistakable prosthetic in
  every one. `White Android Minimal Studio` had a sharper problem: its text
  demanded "nothing else in frame" while describing a standalone android bust,
  which is a direct conflict the moment it stacks under an actual subject
  through Style Mixer. Repointed at the subject's own head, the way `Chrome
  Android` already does. `Golden Mechanical Luxury` and `Atmospheric Sci-Fi
  Mist` got the same anchor treatment on a smaller scale. Checked for category
  drift before and after with the resolver cache built from each library in
  turn — none.

### Added

- **A fifth Scanner craft layer: `🎭 Emotion & Motion`.** The other four
  describe how the picture was made; this one describes what is going on inside
  it — facial state, gaze, body tension, the stage of the action, momentum, and
  the physical evidence movement leaves behind. It is a focus rather than a
  fourteenth agent because 👤 Portrait already carries body language and nothing
  else did: a car mid-corner, an animal mid-gait and a crowd flowing one way are
  the same question asked of a different subject, so the layer has to compose
  with the agent instead of replacing it. It holds the pack's markers-over-labels
  rule hardest of all — "outer brow raised, lower lid tight, mouth corner pulled
  back on one side only", never "happy" — and on a genuinely still frame it says
  what holds the subject still rather than inventing movement.
- **Eight movement modifiers in `⏱️ ЗАХВАТ`** — Wind Gust, Panning Follow,
  Gesture Smear, Long Exposure Ghost, Rolling Shutter Skew, Rear-Curtain Sync,
  Zoom Burst and Handheld Grab Shot. The photo library described the camera in
  detail and the moment almost never: 90 of its 163 presets opened with a lens
  and an aperture, 14 said anything about what was happening in front of it,
  and the one category about movement held three entries. These are shutter
  techniques rather than subjects, so they stack onto any other preset through
  Style Mixer, and each carries a guardrail stopping the model from inventing a
  chase when the scene it lands on is standing still.

- **Two "Cyber Punch" themes** — same brand palette (`#FF0022` red, `#121212`
  ink, `#FFD000` yellow, `#FFFFFF` white), two different treatments. `Cyber
  Punch` is translucent glass over the red/black base with a wide blur and a
  persistent glow on the controls actually carrying state; `Cyber Punch HUD`
  is the opposite instinct — near-opaque, sharp corners, a thin yellow frame
  with corner-bracket accents drawn around the whole node, not its title bar.
  Both were tried first as variants on a throwaway sandbox node (`ui-lab`
  branch, never merged) before either reached the shared theme layer, then
  re-verified number for number against that lab treatment — the first cut
  had ported the palette faithfully but improvised the CSS from other themes'
  idioms.

### Added

- **📡 Channel (`FiLChannel`) — data across the graph with no wire drawn.**
  Plug something into a Channel and every free input of the same type
  elsewhere in the graph picks it up. The pack's 16th node, and it ships
  finished, with the two things a wireless layer dies without:
  - When two channels could feed the same input, or a node has two identical
    inputs a channel can't tell apart (a KSampler's positive/negative),
    nothing auto-wires — the gear on the Channel's own panel opens a target
    picker. Same-type inputs pair to channels by name, with the unnamed
    second wire settled by deduction; a positive/negative question is asked
    once per wire and vaulted in node properties, so reloads never re-ask it.
  - A "Wireless" tab in the bottom panel (next to Essential/View Controls)
    lists every channel in the graph and everything currently unresolved:
    dormant subscriptions, ambiguous picks, type mismatches, unknown channel
    names, self-loops, unused channels.
  - A subgraph is its own scope — a Channel placed inside one serves
    receivers in that same subgraph only.
  - The rest of the kit: a cluster modal for the leftovers, takeover of real
    wires with an Undo toast, inline channel rename, memory pre-highlight of
    the last answer. One async race closed on the way: a wire drawn the
    instant the node exists fires `onConnectionsChange` before the panel's
    async mount has run, so pending ambiguity checks queue on the node itself
    and drain on mount. While in there: style-library category headers
    (StyleBrowser's sidebar and tiles) are translated at display time now
    instead of showing the raw Russian category word from the style key.

- **🎥 Two new Scanner targets for video models: universal `Video` and
  `MiniMax H3`.** Image profiles shape text for diffusion models; video
  models need a shot, not a picture. `Video` is a universal profile for any
  video generator (MiniMax H2, Wan 2.x, whatever reads plain prose) asking
  for one continuous shot description — motion first, light that changes, a
  layered sound clause, exactly one named camera move, `Image N` reference
  roles. `MiniMax H3` writes the platform's timeline format: a header line
  (duration, aspect, style) and gap-free shot blocks with `Sound:` clauses.
  Both carry word ceilings (150/250) because video models follow short
  concrete shots better than dense text. The prompting rewrite further down
  is what live runs against these first versions surfaced.

### Fixed

- **`eta`/`bongmath` no longer crash the samplers that ignore them — and the
  panel now says when they would.** `er_sde`/`sa_solver`/`sa_solver_pece` sat
  in the eta allowlist although their k_diffusion functions take
  `s_noise`/`tau_func` instead — `KSAMPLER.sample()` unpacks `extra_options`
  as `**kwargs`, so every generation with them died in a TypeError. The
  allowlist now matches the real signatures (drift-checked against the
  installed ComfyUI by tests), and unknown/custom samplers fall back to
  introspecting the registered function, which puts RES4LYF's
  `rk`/`legacy_rk`/`rk_beta` on eta. On the frontend, `GET /sampler_options`
  serves the installed samplers that actually read the values; the KSampler
  panel grays eta/Bongmath out with an explanatory tooltip when the selected
  sampler would drop them, and fails open (widgets stay editable) if the
  route is unreachable. `_sample_core` also moves the result to the
  intermediate device/dtype, matching stock `common_ksampler`'s sample path.

- **KSampler's `sampler_name` and `scheduler` now take a wire, and a bad
  linked value gets a readable error.** The two combos stayed widget-only
  while every other KSampler field exposed a socket; a linked value only gets
  type-checked by ComfyUI, never validated against the installed list, so an
  unknown name reached `comfy.samplers` and died there as a bare KeyError
  with no hint which field was at fault — `execute()` now rejects it naming
  what's actually installed. Two things this surfaced: `registerStyledNode`'s
  `getExtraMenuOptions` setter wrote every assignment into one shared closure,
  so packs that patch per node *instance* (cg-use-everywhere) piled their
  menu block up once per node ever created, all inside a single node's
  context menu; and exposing the two combos put three different field
  heights in one KSampler row — a single `--fil-control-h` now governs every
  interactive control, and every labelled row shares one label-column width.

- **Selecting a FiL node no longer stretches ComfyUI's Properties Panel into
  a blank 500–1000px canvas.** The right-side panel has no Vue renderer for
  custom DOM widgets and falls back to `WidgetLegacy.vue`, which draws the
  widget into a blank `<canvas>` sized to whatever `getHeight()` reports.
  `canvasOnly` is the flag the panel's own widget filter checks to skip a
  widget entirely; canvas rendering is untouched. One shared fix in the DOM
  widget host covers every node in the pack.

- **Image Decomposer's language widget defaulted to a value it doesn't
  offer.** `default` was `"English"` while the options are `["en", "ru"]` —
  the widget silently fell back to the first entry while `execute()`'s own
  default stayed `"English"`, so an untouched node sent a value the widget
  never actually showed.

- **Provider calls no longer freeze ComfyUI, and a row of prompt-generation
  edge cases closed.** Model listing, provider probe and auth writes moved
  off the aiohttp event loop via `asyncio.to_thread` — a probe could freeze
  the whole UI for the entire generation, up to the provider timeout. Also:
  every reference image now reaches the provider (Style Mixer Smart Fusion
  silently dropped 3 of 4); Style Mixer preflights model validity and vision
  capability before analysing references; Decomposer keeps error text out of
  `full_prompt` and hashes every frame into the fingerprint, not just the
  first; Scanner derives the two-stage second seed from `seed >= 0` so a
  fixed `seed=0` no longer falls back to a random stage-2 seed;
  `ImageProcessor.max_side` mutation was replaced with a thread-safe
  per-call `with_max_side`; the `RateLimiter` reserves its slot and sleeps
  outside the global lock; and the OpenRouter catalogue is TTL-cached instead
  of refetched on every vision generation.

- **The published archive ships the bundle's sourcemap again.** Since 1.1.0
  the 2.3 MB map was excluded to save space, leaving the 619 KB of minified
  frontend in the archive with nothing to read it against — and the registry
  forbids obfuscated code because it prevents security review. The version
  history lines up exactly: 1.0.0 shipped the map and is Active; 1.1.0 first
  dropped it and is Flagged; 1.1.1 inherited the exclusion. That's a
  correlation, not a stated reason — but the map's `sourcesContent` inlines
  every source file, so shipping it is what makes the bundle reviewable. Two
  tests hold it: one asserts the map both ships and exists on disk, and the
  dev-tooling exclusion list caught the policy flip.

- **Ideogram 4 lost its negative prompt — the v4 API has no such field.**
  The profile carried `supports_negative_prompt: true` from the v3 era; the
  v4 generate endpoint exposes no `negative_prompt`, and Ideogram's own
  prompting guide says to describe the positive visual opposite of anything
  excluded. Negatives now flip positive, same as FLUX/Z-Image/Krea 2, and the
  guidance carries the documented ~150–160-word sweet spot with the most
  important subject first. Every profile in `MODEL_PROMPT_RULES` gained a
  dated vendor-verification note saying where each rule came from
  (Tongyi-MAI, Alibaba Model Studio, krea.ai, ideogram.ai); QWEN moved from
  `partially_verified` to `verified`.

- **Clean QWEN answers stopped being rewritten, and the FLUX JSON fallback
  stopped repeating itself.** QWEN was force-restructured like SDXL even when
  the LLM produced clean prose — but Qwen-Image's own examples are dense
  prose, and a forced labeled breakdown would undo a good answer; now only
  SDXL keeps the always-restructure path, and QWEN restructures only on messy
  markup. And `format_for_flux_json` no longer copies the scene line
  wholesale into the lighting/camera/style fields — for single-paragraph
  prose that line is every line, and the schema used to fill with truncated
  repeats of the same text.

- **Panel state stopped shipping inside the queued prompt, and KSampler's
  seed mode now survives a reload.** `graphToPrompt` puts every widget into
  the node's API inputs unless `serialize: false`, so the whole panel state
  object shipped as an undeclared input — and since the server hashes every
  prompt input into the execution cache key, any change to it defeated the
  cache ("cached" never fired; the sampler re-ran every queue). The flag only
  controls prompt inclusion; workflow persistence is untouched. Separately,
  ComfyUI core creates the seed widget's `control_after_generate` companion
  with `serialize: false`, so the user's "fixed" choice silently came back as
  "randomize" on every load — `fil_state` now carries it across saves, same
  as Scanner and Style Mixer already did.

- **Toggle labels stopped being clipped next to dead space.** A row reserved
  38% for the label and 62% for the control — but a switch is 36px wide and
  pinned to the row's right edge, so the 62% was bought and never used:
  measured on a live 262px Cleaner, the label clipped to 86px while needing
  143px, with ~94px of dead space beside it. `minmax(0, 1fr) auto` gives the
  switch its own width and the label the rest; nothing that was previously
  aligned moves. Shared widget — seven node panels use it.

- **🧹 Cleaner's switches now name the action.** The old compound labels
  ("🧹 GPU cache — Flush cache") ellipsised past reading at the node's
  ~250px width; the label now names the action ("🧹 Flush GPU cache",
  "🧠 Unload models") and the switch position says whether it will happen.
  Widget ids untouched — saved workflows load unchanged.

### Changed

- **Number fields now scrub like ComfyUI's own.** FilNumberInput matches
  ScrubableNumberInput: drag left/right to change the value, a plain click
  enters text-edit instead. Every commit path (typed, arrow-clicked, dragged)
  rounds to the decimal precision `step` implies, so repeated bumps land on
  1.1/1.2/1.3 instead of drifting to 1.2000000000000002. FilSlider drops its
  separate range track — the scrub gesture replaces it, matching the default
  widget's look; every node built on FilSlider (Denoise, Provider Loader,
  HighRes Fix, Color Wizard, Style Mixer, Noise Control) picks this up
  automatically. KSampler's field order now matches the stock KSampler:
  denoise moved after sampler_name/scheduler instead of sitting right after
  cfg.

- **Node widths unified behind an `initialWidth` cap.** LiteGraph's
  `computeSize()` measures the DOM panel's unconstrained content width (a
  combo's longest option, a segmented pill's options in a row), which landed
  row panels at ~400px — visibly wider than native nodes. New nodes now start
  at the contract's declared width instead; saved workflows keep whatever
  size they were saved with. The contracts' `min_size` values were re-tuned
  to the same 250–350 band at the same time.

- **The Provider Manager panel speaks the UI language.** Field labels,
  buttons, status badges, key-state hints and the cache-age suffix now route
  through the en/ru dictionaries. Also pins the vitest worker pool to
  `vmThreads` — the default pools crash on Node 24 with vitest 4.1.10 at
  collection, while `vmThreads` works on both Node 22 (CI) and Node 24.

- **📖 The README caught up with the pack it describes.** The Russian feature
  table still said six themes (ten since 1.1.1's four landed), and the
  settings table never documented *Theme applies to* / *Theme animations*.
  The prompting system — five bullet points with no examples — was replaced
  with a per-axis Optic Scanner breakdown (agent table, focus stacking, style
  contract modes, prompt/negative_prompt semantics) grounded in the actual
  code, plus short practical tips for the other complex nodes. LoRA Dataset
  Forge, Style Mixer, Image Decomposer and Color Wizard gained one-line
  example chains in both languages naming real inputs/outputs. CI badge
  added.

- **Internal dev docs left git tracking.** CLAUDE.md, audit.md,
  audit-next.md, fix.md and .claude/launch.json are maintainer-only notes
  (the last one also hardcoded local disk paths); they stay local now instead
  of sitting in the public repo view.

## 1.1.1 (2026-07-30)

Repairs found by a full audit of 1.1.0 — code, tests, the ComfyUI host seam,
and every configured provider checked with real requests — plus style preview
thumbnails, which had never shipped for most of the library. Nothing here
renames or removes anything; saved workflows load unchanged. One change does
alter output: five art styles named no drawing technique and were rewritten to
ask for one, mirroring the photo-style fix already in 1.1.0. Their keys are
untouched, but a workflow using one of the five will get a different prompt.

### Fixed

- **A cut-off model answer was passed off as a finished one.** Both response
  parsers returned the model's text before checking whether it had been cut
  off, so a partial reply only got caught when there was no text at all. Found
  live: asked to describe three shapes at a low token budget, Gemini answered
  "Red circle, green" and the pack forwarded it as the finished prompt: on a
  reasoning model it was worse, an unfinished internal-monologue block got
  unwrapped and sent out as the prompt instead of a result. The existing retry
  ladder now runs for a partial answer, not only an empty one.
- **112 NSFW styles were accepted by 🎨 Style Mixer and impossible to select.**
  The node built its style list from all four libraries; the panel only knew
  about two of them. Both sides now read the same list.
- **♻️ Seed's panel rejected values the node accepted.** The widget capped at
  999,999,999,999; the node allows up to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, same as every
  other seed in the pack — only this one had been missed.
- **`^` in a number field computed bitwise XOR instead of a power.** `2^10`
  silently returned 8 instead of 1024, in the field used for image dimensions.
- **An external write to 🔀 Cyber Switch's `enable` never reached the widget
  the backend reads.** Loading a workflow or an undo could leave the panel
  showing the right state while the backend read a stale one; clicking the
  switch was unaffected.
- **The two example workflows under `docs/workflows/` were rebuilt.** Both
  were a snapshot of an older node schema, and opening either landed values on
  the wrong fields with no warning.
- **KSampler's preview-with-workflow path, and an unreadable `config.yaml` or
  `API.env`, failed silently.** Both now log a warning instead of vanishing.
- **Four of the pack's ten settings never appeared in the settings panel** —
  including the theme picker. ComfyUI reads a setting's `category` as
  `[group, section, slot]`, and with only two levels it treats the section
  itself as the slot, so settings sharing a section overwrite each other and
  only the last registered is drawn. The panel is also reorganised: six
  sections, four of them holding a single row, are now three — Appearance,
  Canvas and General.
- **Two of the new palettes had unreadable text.** `muted` is a text colour, and
  Cyberpunk's measured 3.00:1 against the panel behind it where 4.5:1 is the
  floor. Contrast is now checked by test across all ten themes.
- **Five art styles named no drawing technique and rendered as photographs**
  — `Cosmic Dream Girl`, `Holographic Y2K Pop Star`, `Alien Fashion Runway`,
  `Bloom Soft Girl Aesthetic`, `Abstract Cyber Shape Design`.
- Secrets could reach an archive published by hand from a working copy:
  `.comfyignore` was missing `API.env` and `data/auth.json`.
- The smoke suite — the one check that starts a real ComfyUI and verifies the
  pack registers and draws in it — could not run on a portable install.

### Added

- **Four more themes** — `Cyberpunk 2077`, `Neo Emerald`, `NFT Vibe` and
  `Hollywood Teal`, bringing the set to ten.
- **Two controls over how a theme behaves.** **Theme applies to** extends the
  tint past this pack's own nodes — to nodes wired to them, or to every node on
  the canvas. It colours the title bar only, never the node body: body colour is
  what LiteGraph saves into the workflow file, so painting a foreign node that
  way would travel to whoever the workflow is sent to and outlive uninstalling
  this pack. **Theme animations** stops the looping flourishes some themes run
  (Pipboy's CRT scanline sweep, Neo Emerald's pulsing orb) and starts off when
  the system asks for reduced motion.
- **Save a theme as a ComfyUI color palette.** The command
  "FiL_Design_ImageMind — Save this theme as a ComfyUI color palette" builds a
  palette from the current theme and adds it to Settings → Appearance → Color
  Palette. It only adds: your active palette stays active, and applying — or
  undoing — is done in ComfyUI's own picker. Socket colours are copied through
  untouched, because those encode the data type (IMAGE blue, MODEL purple) and
  that reading is shared with every other pack.
- **Style preview thumbnails for the whole photo and art libraries** — 292 of
  404 styles now show an actual picture instead of just a name; the two NSFW
  libraries are not yet covered. Generated by a new, checked-in script,
  replacing one that had been lost.
- **`config.example.yaml` ships with the pack.** The README always described
  editing `config.yaml`, which is git-ignored on purpose and never reached
  anyone.
- **`tools/live_provider_check.py`** — a manual check that sends a real image
  to every configured provider and verifies the description it gets back
  against what was actually drawn. Kept out of the automated test suite
  because CI carries no provider keys.
- **FilBrowser, a shared browsing frame, replaces the separate pickers for
  provider models and prompt styles.** A resizable window with a left column
  of filter groups that each carry a count, ranked search, favourites, and a
  recently-used list kept distinct from favourites. Search ranks instead of
  filtering: `gpt-4o` used to sit below every longer name that merely
  contained it, because a substring filter kept the provider's own order.

## 1.1.0 (2026-07-29)

There is no 1.0.1. It was tagged, published, and pulled from the registry the
same day, and publishing again under that number did not go through — so the
work below, which is what 1.0.1 would have been plus the features that landed
after it, ships under the next number instead. Anyone who installed 1.0.1 in
the hours it was listed needs nothing beyond updating.

Repairs to 1.0.0, plus the removal of three features that reached further into
ComfyUI than a node pack should. One change does alter what the nodes produce:
the photo style library was rewritten to actually ask for photographs, so a
workflow using a photo style will not reproduce its 1.0.0 output. Everything
else leaves generation alone.

### Breaking

- **🧹 Cleaner**: the four per-kind switches (`unload_diffusion`, `unload_clip`,
  `unload_vae`, `unload_control`) are one `unload_models` switch. They sorted
  loaded models by matching class names, and could not do it reliably — a
  model's name and its nested submodules' names were matched as one string, and
  `modelpatcher`, the wrapper around every model in ComfyUI, counted as a
  diffusion marker, so anything unrecognised was unloaded as diffusion whatever
  the other switches said. A workflow loaded in the UI carries its old
  `unload_diffusion` value onto the new switch, since `widgets_values` maps
  positionally. A saved API-format prompt cannot: ComfyUI passes only inputs
  that are links or still in the schema, so the three remaining names are
  dropped and the node runs on its defaults — check the switch after updating
  if you had unloading turned off.
- **⚡ KSampler**: `latent_image` → `latent`, `optional_vae` → `vae`, matching
  the outputs they pair with. Workflows addressing them by the old names in the
  API format still load.
- **`/` no longer opens the add-node search, and `Shift+?` is rebindable.** In
  1.0.0 both keys were claimed by a capture-phase listener the user could
  neither see in ComfyUI's keybinding settings nor override. `Shift+?` is back
  as one registered command — it appears in those settings and can be rebound
  or cleared, and `Shortcuts.Enabled` switches the set off. `/` is not coming
  back: a bare key claimed from every context collides with whatever else
  wants it, and the search field it reached for was hunted through five
  guessed CSS selectors. Focusing core's own search is core's business.
- **Settings removed**: `RequestTimeout` and `AutoCleanVRAM` were never read by
  anything — timeouts come from `config.yaml` and per-provider defaults, and
  VRAM cleanup is the Cleaner node's job. `RunButton.Enabled` /
  `RunButton.AnimationDuration` were never registered with ComfyUI.

### Fixed

- **The photo style library asks for photographs now.** A diffusion model
  picks the medium from the words it is given, and 69 of the 157 photo styles
  named no medium at all — "bohemian interior design, layered textiles, warm
  ambient lighting" describes a room, never a picture of one, so the model was
  free to answer with an illustration or a 3D render, and did. Every entry now
  carries the lens, light and capture it would be taken with, and six that
  asked outright for the thing the category exists to avoid (`photo-real
  render look`, `digital HDR rendering`) are gone. The deeper cause was in the
  engine: category detection reads free text and could not see which library a
  style came from, so ten photo styles resolved into categories whose own
  rules strip photography back out — `comic` replaces "photograph" with
  "illustration", and `Cybernetic Arm Close-Up` resolved to `oil_painting`.
  The resolver consults the photo libraries directly now, because membership
  is a fact and a keyword match is a guess. Style keys are unchanged, so no
  workflow needs editing — but prompts built from a photo style will differ
  from 1.0.0.
- **The global wheel listener is gone.** A capture-phase `wheel` handler on
  `window`, installed at import, put this pack ahead of every other extension
  for every wheel event in the application — other packs' wheel-driven
  carousels, value tweaks and lazy loading never fired. What remains is one
  listener on the pack's own widget host, which never sees an event outside a
  FiL panel, and `Wheel.Enabled` switches even that off.
- **Node panels no longer poll the layout.** Each mounted widget ran a 400 ms
  `setInterval` and measured `scrollHeight` from LiteGraph's draw loop — a
  forced reflow per frame per node. The ResizeObserver it was compensating for
  was watching `host`, whose box stops following the content as soon as
  anything pins it; observing the panel itself removed both the timer and the
  per-frame measurement.
- **Context menus no longer break other extensions.** `getExtraMenuOptions` is
  wrapped through an accessor that captures the previous handler on read, so an
  extension patching it the usual way cannot end up calling itself — with
  cg-use-everywhere installed, every context menu died on "Maximum call stack
  size exceeded". ComfyUI-Manager's "Fix node (recreate)" is repaired in place:
  its own version leaves the old node stacked under the new one whenever any
  input is connected.
- **Style Mixer kept its wires** across a reload, and the panel state survives a
  shifted `widgets_values` array.
- **Connection toasts** were declared with a default of `false`, read with a
  fallback of `true`, and never registered with ComfyUI — so the fallback was
  the only value anyone got.
- **Default LLM Provider** could not be set to OpenAI: the option list was
  hand-written and had drifted from the provider registry.
- **A resized Optic Scanner shrank a little on every load.** A panel dragged
  to +200px of height came back at +162, then +122, until it sat on its
  content. On the first sync the stretch was recovered as "box minus content
  height" while the content height was still the caller's estimate rather than
  the fresh measurement — `scanner.ts` guesses 580 for a panel that measures
  540, and that 40px gap was charged to the drag once per load.
- **Theme flourishes on node titles never ran.** Every cyberpunk glow and
  pipboy text-shadow keyed off `.comfy-node-header`, a class no shipped
  frontend emits — the Vue renderer names it `.lg-node-header`. Under the
  default canvas renderer a node has no DOM at all, so these stay inert there
  by nature; the node-body rules sit on this pack's own shell and always
  applied. The pixaroma skin, left blank on the assumption that flat panels
  mean no flourish, is filled in.
- **🧹 Cleaner printed widget ids instead of labels** — `clean_vram` ran down
  the left edge next to human text on the right. V3 schemas take a
  `display_name` per input and nothing in the pack used it, so LiteGraph fell
  back to the raw id. The ids are untouched; saved workflows address widgets
  by them.
- **The model picker could take itself down on import.** Its localStorage
  reads run at module scope and were unguarded while the writes had been
  wrapped all along, so a blocked-storage profile or an opaque origin — where
  the global is undefined — broke the whole picker rather than one preference.
- Reading any setting logged a deprecation warning on every call.

### Added

- **Provider panel**: each card links to the page that issues the credential,
  and shows the masked key together with where it came from — this panel,
  an environment variable, or `config.yaml`. Delete is offered only for what
  the panel itself saved. The Base URL field appears for the local servers and
  for anyone with a custom endpoint already saved, instead of on every card.
- **Running node highlight** (`RunFx.Mode`): the header pulses for as long as
  the node executes, instead of a 400 ms flash. Covers this pack's nodes by
  default, optionally all of them.
- **Widget inputs have their dots back, next to the field they drive.** A Vue
  panel hides the native widget, and hiding a widget hides its input slot with
  it — so a field that can be graph-driven had no visible socket, or one in a
  fallback row with no clue which field it fed. A field with a wire attached
  goes read-only: what you typed there would be overwritten by the link when
  the prompt is queued, and a control that silently discards input is worse
  than one that says it is taken. Covers Color Wizard, Dataset Forge, Style
  Mixer, Upscaler and Upscaler Simple.
- **Starred models in the picker.** OpenRouter lists 367 models and OpenAI 76;
  the type and tier filters narrow that by kind, but the three or four you
  actually use stay scattered through whatever is left. A star pulls them back
  and a badge filters down to them. Favourites are keyed `provider::model`, so
  `openai/gpt-oss-20b` starred on Groq does not light up under OpenRouter
  where it is a different offering, and they live in localStorage rather than
  inside a saved graph — a per-machine convenience should not travel with a
  workflow.
- **🔬 HighRes Fix folds its rarely-touched controls into an ADVANCED
  section.** Nine rows showed by default and six of them are set once and
  never looked at again. The section remembers whether you left it open, per
  saved workflow; a fresh node starts closed.
- **Six photo styles on the axis the library was thin on** — Smartphone
  Computational, Direct Flash Night, Cinestill 800T Halation, Tri-X Push 1600,
  Scanned Print and Rembrandt Key Light. The library ran 96 of 157 entries on
  what is in front of the camera and 20 on what the camera is, and since Style
  Mixer stacks three styles with weights, an entry on the "how it was shot"
  axis multiplies across every scene while another scene only adds itself.

## 1.0.0 (2026-07-28)

First public release. Ships 15 nodes under `🎨 FiL Design/*`, each one taken
through the hardening checklist in `docs/release/HARDENING_LEDGER.md` (audit →
UX → functional fixes → UI → tests → contract → live smoke on a running
ComfyUI), on a Vue 3 + Pinia frontend with a seven-palette design system.

Everything below shipped in this release. The version numbers in the git
history before this tag were internal iterations that were never published.

### Nodes

- **`🔍 Upscaler Advanced` (`FiLUpscaleTileCalc`)** — tiling geometry: overlap,
  `non_square_tiles` clamped at 1.5:1, `auto_overlap`, `auto_fix_thin_edges`,
  and edge tiles that shift inward instead of being zero-padded. Emits the
  cropped `tiles` batch, `latent`/`latent_tiles`, and a FLOAT `overlap`.
- **`🔍 Upscaler Simple` (`FiLUpscaleSimple`)** — the same panel with a required
  upscale model and only the four core outputs. Delegates 100% of the geometry
  to `FiLUpscaleTileCalc`, so the two can never drift apart.
- **`🧩 Tile Assembly` (`FiLTileAssembly`)** — stitches processed tiles back to
  full resolution using the layout the calculator produced.
- **`🔬 HighRes Fix` (`FiLHighResFix`)** — upscale+resample passes with its own
  seed row, or the sampler's seed reused.
- **`🎛️ Noise Control` (`FiLNoiseControl`)** — RNG source (cpu/gpu) and seed
  variation as a script for `FiLKSampler`, built on the public `comfy.sample`
  API rather than patching the CFG denoiser.
- **`🔀 Cyber Switch` (`FiLSignalSwitch`)** — any-type pass-through gate for
  muting a branch without rewiring it. OFF returns ComfyUI's `ExecutionBlocker`
  so consumers skip silently and the rest of the graph still finishes; ON with
  nothing connected blocks the same way but says so on the node.
- **`📚 LoRA Dataset Forge` (`FiLDatasetForge`)** — takes an image batch and
  writes a training-ready LoRA dataset in one pass: kohya-style aspect-ratio
  buckets around the chosen base resolution (512 – 1536, step 64), one LLM
  caption per frame through `🔌 Provider Loader`, and either the `kohya` layout
  (`<name>/img/<repeats>_<trigger> <class>/` plus an sd-scripts `dataset.toml`)
  or a `flat` image+caption folder. Always writes a `manifest.json` recording
  per-frame bucket, crop box, caption and hash.
  - Caption prompts encode the rule that decides whether a LoRA generalizes:
    describe what varies, never describe the invariant named in `dont_caption` —
    that belongs to the trigger word.
  - `dry_run` plans the whole run without touching disk; `write_mode=overwrite`
    deletes only the image/caption pairs this node owns, leaving foreign files
    in the folder alone.
  - No upscaling: sources smaller than their bucket are still written, but
    counted in `upscaled_count` and flagged in the report.
- **`🧹 Cleaner` (`FiLNeuroCleaner`)** — explicit VRAM/model toggles, replacing
  an earlier design with 14 checkboxes and Windows ctypes placebo code.
- **`🕵️ Optic Scanner`, `🎨 Style Mixer`, `🌈 Color Wizard`, `🧬 Decomposer`,
  `🌱 Seed`, `🎲 KSampler`** (with `eta` (η) for ancestral/SDE samplers and
  `bongmath`), and **`🔌 Provider Loader`**.

### Design system

- **Every text token clears WCAG AA in all seven palettes**, measured against
  the backdrop a widget actually sits on — the node body is `--fil-surface-bg`
  (a 6% tint) over the color LiteGraph paints on its canvas, with rows stacking
  `--fil-surface-1/2` above that, which runs consistently lighter than the
  palette's nominal `panel`/`panelAlt` and is worth 0.5–1.0 of ratio.
  - Text painted on the accent (active segment, primary button, active pill) is
    each theme's own darkest tone at 4.9–10.8:1, not white — white measured as
    low as 1.54:1 for the 11–13px labels that use it.
  - Nine rules that used the raw accent as small *text* (active tab, selected
    combo option, active chip, status badges, the presets title) use
    `--fil-accent-text` — the accent pulled 35% toward the theme's text color —
    landing at 5.17–11.01:1 with the hue still readable. Icons keep the raw
    accent; glyphs are non-text and need only 3:1.
  - `--fil-muted` and `--fil-danger`/`--fil-ok` are tuned per palette against
    the composited backdrop: `muted` blended toward each theme's own text color
    so it keeps its character, `danger` toward white (black on the light
    palette) so it stays red rather than turning brown against Pipboy's green.
  - Verified across 204 rendered elements in all seven palettes on both a light
    and a dark ComfyUI. Ratios are recorded next to the values in
    `styles/brand.ts` so the next edit can't quietly undo this.
- **Light mode follows ComfyUI by luminance.** The mode is derived from the
  luminance of ComfyUI's own `--bg-color`, which covers third-party and
  hand-made palettes that no list of names would catch, and a `MutationObserver`
  picks up palette switches live. Only the *default* theme follows it — picking
  Cyberpunk means Cyberpunk on a light canvas too.
- **Six themes**, including *Travelmate* and *Pixaroma* — the latter matching
  the `ComfyUI-Pixaroma` node pack's own brand colors, so a graph mixing both
  packs reads as one system instead of two. Flat panels, no glow or scanline,
  because that is what their editor chrome looks like.
- **`--fil-muted` is text-only; field outlines come from `--fil-border`.**
  Overlay surfaces (section headers, segmented troughs, toggle tracks, inset
  fields) use `--fil-surface-1/2/3` and `--fil-inset`, which is what lets the
  light theme flip their polarity.
- **Uniform control heights** — `--fil-control-h` (30px) for text/select/number
  fields, `--fil-control-h-lg` (34px) for seed rows and icon buttons.
- **Shared field widgets** — `FilTextInput`, `FilTextArea` and `FilSeedRow`
  (seed readout + Random/Use last/New fixed), each previously pasted into two
  or more components and already drifting apart.
- **The seed row tells state from action.** Solid accent means "this is the
  mode you are in", an accent outline means "this button does something".
  `🔬 HighRes Fix` is 380px wide because below that the seed captions clip in
  both languages.
- **State colors follow the theme.** `🔀 Cyber Switch` tints ON with
  `--fil-ok` and OFF with `--fil-danger` instead of a fixed emerald/red
  gradient that matched no palette but its own; the label stays `--fil-text`,
  since `--fil-danger` as text on its own tint runs 1.96–4.04:1. Optic
  Scanner's selected style button holds its accent still rather than running a
  `pulse-neon` loop forever on every scanner in the graph.

### Infrastructure

- **`common/brand.py`** / **`frontend/src/constants/brand.ts`** — single source
  of truth for the brand token and its derived forms (category root, settings
  prefix, route slug, log tag), so future rebrands don't need a repo-wide
  string sweep. `/health` serves `common.brand.VERSION`, which a test keeps in
  step with `pyproject.toml`.
- **`common/dataset/`** — `bucketing` (bucket math, cover-resize, center/entropy
  crop), `captioning` (prompts, normalisation, per-frame batch loop) and
  `writer` (layouts, sidecars, TOML, manifest, path sanitisation).
- **`common/release_gate.py`** — staging gate that registers only node-ids
  listed in `RELEASE_NODES`, so a new node stays out of the ComfyUI menu until
  it has been through the checklist. `FIL_RELEASE_ALL=1` bypasses it.
- **`tools/preflight_check.py` / `tools/scan_node_conflicts.py`** — static
  release preflight and a scan for node-id collisions with other node packs.
- **Full ru/en localization** — every panel, tooltip and toast goes through
  `data/locales/*`; no hardcoded UI strings left.
- **Node option lists are read from the Pydantic contract**, so a panel cannot
  offer a value the backend rejects.

### Notes for anyone who ran the pre-release code

The project was developed as `FiL_LLM` and renamed before publication. Nothing
was ever released under the old name, so there is no compatibility shim: the
package/import name, the `🎨 FiL Design/*` node categories, the
`/fil_design_imagemind/*` route prefix, the `FiL_Design_ImageMind.*` settings
keys, the `dist/fil_design_imagemind.js` bundle name and the `FiLError`
exception base all changed at once. `FiLBeforeAfterCompare` — its node, its
`/compare/save` route and its `output/FiL_LLM/compare/` folder — was removed
with nothing replacing it.

---

The sections below belong to the pre-rename `FiL_LLM` project and are kept for
provenance. Their version numbers are unrelated to the scheme above.

## 4.0.0 (2026-07-05)

### Breaking
- **Migrated backend nodes from V1 to V3 ComfyUI API.** All 7 node classes now
  inherit from `io.ComfyNode` and use declarative `define_schema()` / `async def execute()`
  instead of `INPUT_TYPES()` / `FUNCTION`.
- **Entry point changed:** `__init__.py` now exports `comfy_entrypoint()` returning a
  `ComfyExtension` subclass instead of `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`.
- **Version bumped to 4.0.0** due to internal API change (workflow JSON format unchanged).

### Changed
- Nodes are now **classmethods** (stateless) — all internal singletons (processor,
  style_manager, prompt_gen, model_client, style_enforcer) lifted to module level.
- `IS_CHANGED` → `fingerprint_inputs`, `VALIDATE_INPUTS` → `validate_inputs`.
- `Combo` inputs use typed `io.Combo.Input` instead of raw `(["a","b"],)` tuples.
- Hidden inputs use `io.Hidden.unique_id` / `io.Hidden.prompt` / `io.Hidden.extra_pnginfo`.
- `RETURN_TYPES` / `RETURN_NAMES` → typed `io.*.Output` list in schema.
- Dependencies: `comfy_api>=0.0.3` added to `requirements.txt`.

### Removed
- `NODE_CLASS_MAPPINGS`, `NODE_DISPLAY_NAME_MAPPINGS`, `SEARCH_ALIASES` from all node files.
- `validate_node_mappings()` validator (V3 handles registration natively).
- `_display_banner()` with ANSI art (V3 extension system logs registration).

## 3.0.0 (2026-07-05)

### Breaking
- **Cutover to frontend v3 (Vue 3 + TS + Vite + Pinia).** Old Vanilla JS `web/` directory deleted.
  `WEB_DIRECTORY` now points to `./frontend/dist`. No backward compatibility layer.

### Added
- **Vue 3 design system:** 9 widget components (`FilButton`, `FilSegmented`,
  `FilChipGrid`, `FilChipList`, `FilSection`, `FilNumberInput`, `FilSlider`,
  `FilSelect`, `FilInfo`) + SVGs-in-JS icon library.
- **FilModal** — Teleport + focus trap + Esc/backdrop dismiss.
- **FilHelpPopup** — renders help content (body, bullets, table, code) per
  `helpStore` registry entry.
- **FilColorPicker** + **useColorPicker** — context-menu (`getExtraMenuOptions`)
  colour swatch picker for node tint.
- **useShortcuts** — declarative `commands`/`keybindings`/`menuCommands` API
  (advanced guide §11, §12.3) with fallback legacy keydown handler.
- **useConnectionFx / useRunButtonFx / useAdaptiveTitleInk** — effect composables
  from the advanced guide.
- **Pydantic v2 backend contracts** (`common/contracts/`) — single source of truth
  for Python↔TS types, exposed via `/fil_llm/node_contracts`.
- **`scripts/gen_contracts.mjs`** — offline TS type generator from Pydantic schemas.
- **Backend metadata** — `DESCRIPTION`, `OUTPUT_TOOLTIPS`, `SEARCH_ALIASES`,
  `tooltip`, `advanced: True`, `VALIDATE_INPUTS` on all 7 node classes.

### Fixed
- **domWidgetHost.ts** — uses official `node.addDOMWidget(name, "custom", el, opts)`
  (was broken with non-existent `app.widgets.registerDOMWidget`).
- **Vue external** — set `vue` and `pinia` as externals; bundle drops from 59→14 KB gzip.
- **`control_after_generate` seed bug** — custom `<FilSegmented>` Random/Fixed
  avoids ComfyUI issue #11905.
- **Toast system** — routes through `extensionManager.toast` when available.
- **Settings API** — `category: ["FiL_LLM", ...]` arrays + `readSetting<T>()` helper.
- **UnicodeEncodeError** on Windows — `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in scripts.

### Changed
- All 7 node Vue components refactored to single `state: FilNodeState` prop.
- `IS_CHANGED` on FiLNeuroCleaner returns `time.time()` when clean requested.
- `VALIDATE_INPUTS` on FiLOpticScanner checks config slot.

### Removed
- Entire `web/` directory (Vanilla JS legacy): ~30 files across `web/core/`,
  `web/nodes/`, `web/settings/`, `web/assets/`.
- All references to `app.widgets.registerDOMWidget` — gone.
