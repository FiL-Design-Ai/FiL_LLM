"""What a model can actually do — asked of the provider, not guessed.

Every vision badge in the pack used to come from substring matching over the
model id (``VISION_MODEL_HINTS``). A live audit of all five cloud providers on
2026-07-29 showed what that costs:

* OpenAI — 0 of 119 models were badged, ``gpt-4o`` and the whole ``gpt-5.x``
  line included, because no hint token matched them.
* Groq — ``gpt-oss-120b/20b/safeguard-20b`` were badged (token ``gpt-oss``)
  while Groq declares them ``input_modalities: ["text"]``; meanwhile the one
  model Groq *does* declare image-capable, ``qwen/qwen3.6-27b``, was badged
  text.
* OpenRouter — 190 of the 211 models it declares image-capable were badged
  text, the entire Anthropic and Gemini lines among them.

Three of the five providers publish the answer in their own ``/models``
response: OpenRouter as ``architecture.input_modalities``, Groq as
``input_modalities``, Cloudflare as ``properties.vision``. This module reads
that instead of guessing, and keeps guessing only where nobody publishes
anything — OpenAI (whose ``/models`` returns id/created/owned_by and nothing
else) and the two local providers.
