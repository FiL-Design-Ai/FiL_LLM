"""FiL_Design_ImageMind node-contract registry.

The contracts describe the *frontend-visible* widget layer; the Python node
classes still own their own `define_schema()` for ComfyUI core. Every node class
must have an entry here — `tests/test_node_contracts.py` enforces that parity.

Each contract lives in its own module under `nodes/`; this file only collects
them. It used to hold all nineteen inline, at 900 lines, importing from eight
modules under `common/` — so changing one node's widgets meant editing the file
every other node's contract was read from, and every importer of the registry
paid to build all of them. `tests/test_contract_generation.py` keeps the
collected result honest: what the frontend imports must be what this produces.

`scripts/gen_contracts.mjs` renders that result into
`frontend/src/api/contracts.ts`.
