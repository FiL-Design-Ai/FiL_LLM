"""The working copy must not contain a second copy of itself.

A `.kilo/worktrees/efficacious-kingfisher/` checkout sat inside this repository
holding a full, stale duplicate of every source file — 75 MB of it, ignored by
git and therefore invisible to every check in the suite. Nothing was wrong with
the repository; the damage was to every search run against it. `grep` for
`gen_contracts.mjs` answered with the duplicate's copies first, and an edit or a
reading made against those is an edit made to a file nothing loads.

Git worktrees are the mechanism (`git worktree add` places a real checkout
wherever it is told), and they are useful — the two that remain live in
`../FiL_Design_ImageMind.worktrees/`, outside this tree, where they cost
nothing. This test does not object to worktrees. It objects to one living
*inside* the directory it is a copy of.
